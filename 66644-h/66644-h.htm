<h2 class="main">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On October 12, 1909, Francisco Ferrer y Guardia was shot in the trenches of the Montjuich
Fortress at Barcelona. A Military Council had found him guilty of being “head of the
insurrection” which had, a few months before, lit the flame of civil war in the city
and province. The clergy had openly petitioned the Spanish Premier, when Ferrer was
arrested, to look to the Modern School and its founder for the source of the revolutionary
feeling; and the Premier had, instead of rebuking them, promised to do so. When Ferrer
was arrested the prosecution spent many weeks in collecting evidence against him,
and granted a free pardon to several men who <i>were</i> implicated in the riot, for testifying against him. These three or four men were
the only witnesses out of fifty who would have been heard patiently in a civil court
of justice, and even their testimony would at once have crumbled under cross-examination.
But there was <span class="pageNum" id="pb.viii">[<a href="#pb.viii">viii</a>]</span>no cross-examination, and no witnesses were brought before the court. Five weeks were
occupied in compiling an enormously lengthy indictment of Ferrer; then twenty-four
hours were given to an inexperienced officer, chosen at random, to analyse it and
prepare a defense. Evidence sent in Ferrer’s favour was confiscated by the police;
the witnesses who could have disproved the case against him were kept in custody miles
away from Barcelona; and documents which would have tended to show his innocence were
refused to the defending officer. And after the mere hearing of the long and hopelessly
bewildering indictment (in which the evidence was even falsified), and in spite of
the impassioned protest of the defending officer against the brutal injustice of the
proceedings, the military judges found Ferrer guilty, and he was shot.
</p>
<p>Within a month of the judicial murder of Ferrer I put the whole abominable story before
the British public. I showed the deep corruption of Church and politics in Spain,
and proved that clergy and politicians had conspired to use the gross and pliable
machinery of “military justice” to remove a man whose sole aim was to open the eyes
of the Spanish <span class="pageNum" id="pb.ix">[<a href="#pb.ix">ix</a>]</span>people. A prolonged and passionate controversy followed. That controversy has not
altered a line of my book. Mr. William Archer, in a cold and impartial study of the
matter, has fully supported my indictment of the prosecution of Ferrer; and Professor
Simarro, of Madrid University, has, in a voluminous study of the trial (<i lang="es">El Proceso Ferrer</i>—two large volumes), quoted whole chapters of my little work. When, in 1912, the Supreme
Military Council of Spain was forced to declare that no single act of violence could
be directly or indirectly traced to Ferrer (whereas the chief witness for the prosecution
had sworn that he saw Ferrer leading a troop of rioters), and ordered the restoration
of his property, the case for his innocence was closed. It remains only for Spain
to wipe the foul stain from its annals by removing the bones of the martyred teacher
from the trenches of Montjuich, and to declare, with <i>real</i> Spanish pride, that a grave injustice had been done.
</p>
<p>Meantime, the restoration of Ferrer’s property has enabled his trustees to resume
his work. Among his papers they found a manuscript account, from his own pen, of the
origin and ideals of the Modern <span class="pageNum" id="pb.x">[<a href="#pb.x">x</a>]</span>School, and their first act is to give it to the world. In 1906 Ferrer had been arrested
on the charge of complicity in the attempt of Morral to assassinate the King. He was
kept in jail for a year, and the most scandalous efforts were made, in the court and
the country, to secure a judicial murder; but it was a civil (or civilised) trial,
and the charge was contemptuously rejected. Going to the Pyrenees in the early summer
of 1908 to recuperate, Ferrer determined to write the simple story of his school,
and it is this I now offer to English readers.
</p>
<p>In this work Ferrer depicts himself more truly and vividly than any friend of his
has ever done. For my part, I had never seen Ferrer, and never seen Spain; but I was
acquainted with Spanish life and letters, and knew that there had been committed in
the twentieth century one of those old-world crimes by which the children of darkness
seek to arrest the advance of man. I interpreted Ferrer from his work, his letters,
a few journalistic articles he had written—he had never published a book, and the
impressions of his friends and pupils. In this book the man portrays himself, and
describes his aims with a candour that all will appreciate. The less foolish of <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xi">[<a href="#pb.xi">xi</a>]</span>his enemies have ceased to assert that he organised or led the riot at Barcelona in
1909. It was, they say, the tendency, the subtle aim, of his work which made him responsible.
It may be remembered that the <i>Saturday Review</i> and other journals published the most unblushingly mendacious letters, from anonymous
correspondents, saying that they had seen posters on the walls of Ferrer’s schools
inciting children to violence. As the very zealous police did not at the trial even
mention Ferrer’s schools, or the text-books used in them, these lies need no further
exposure. But many persist in thinking, since there is now nothing further to think
to the disadvantage of Ferrer, that his schools were really hot-beds of rebellion
and were very naturally suppressed.
</p>
<p>Here is the full story of the Modern School, told in transparently simple language.
Here is the whole man, with all his ideals, aims, and resentments. It shows, as we
well knew, and could have proved with overwhelming force at his trial had we been
permitted, that he was absolutely opposed to violence ever since, in his youth, he
had taken part in an abortive revolution. It tells how he came to distrust <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xii">[<a href="#pb.xii">xii</a>]</span>violence and those who used it; how he concluded that the moral and intellectual training
of children was to be the sole work of his career; how, when he obtained the funds,
he turned completely from politics, and devoted himself to educating children in knowledge
of science and in sentiments of peace and brotherhood.
</p>
<p>It tells also, with the same transparent plainness, why his noble-minded work incurred
such violent enmity. He naively boasts that the education in the Modern School was
free from dogmas. It was not, and cannot be in any school, free from dogmas, for dogma
means “teaching,” and he gave teaching of a very definite character. Mr. Belloc’s
indictment of his schools is, like Mr. Belloc’s indictment of his character and guilt,
evidently based on complete ignorance of the facts and a very extensive knowledge
of the recklessly mendacious literature of his opponents. Even Mr. Archer’s account
of his school is grossly misleading. The Modern School was “avowedly a nursery of
rebellious citizens” only in the same sense as is any Socialist Sunday-school in England
or Germany; and the Spanish Government has never claimed, and could not claim, for
a moment <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xiii">[<a href="#pb.xiii">xiii</a>]</span>the right to close it, except in so far as it falsely charged the founder with crime
and confiscated his property.
</p>
<p>Ferrer’s school was thoroughly rationalistic, and this embittered the clergy—for his
system was spreading rapidly through Spain—without in the least infringing Spanish
law. Further, Ferrer’s school explicitly taught children that militarism was a crime,
that the unequal distribution of wealth was a thing to be abhorred, that the capitalist
system was bad for the workers, and that political government is an evil. He had a
perfect right under Spanish law to found a school to teach his ideas; as any man has
under English or German law. The prohibited and damnable thing would be even to hint
to children that, when they grew up, they might look forward to altering the industrial
and political system by violence. This Ferrer not only did not teach, but strenuously
opposed. We have overwhelming proof of this at every step of his later career. But
he was a child of the workers, and he had a passionate and noble resentment of the
ignorance, poverty, and squalor of the lives of so large a proportion of the workers.
He was also an Anarchist, in the sense of Tolstoi; he <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xiv">[<a href="#pb.xiv">xiv</a>]</span>believed that liberty was essential to the development of man, and central government
an evil. But, as rigorously as Tolstoi, he relied on persuasion and abhorred violence.
I would call attention to Chapter VI of this book, in which he pleads for “the co-education
of the rich and poor”; and there were children of middle-class parents, even of university-professors,
in his school. Most decidedly he preached no class-hatred or violence. I do not share
his academic and innocent Anarchist ideal—which is far nearer to Conservatism than
to Socialism—but I share to the full that intense and passionate longing for the uplifting
and brightening of the poor, and for the destruction of superstition, which was the
supreme ideal of his life and of his work. For that he was shot.
</p>
<p>Finally, the reader must strictly bear in mind the Spanish atmosphere of this tragedy.
When Ferrer describes “existing schools” he means the schools of Spain, which are,
for the most part, a mockery and a shame. When he talks of “ruling powers” he has
in mind the politicians of Spain, my indictment of whom, in their own language, has
never been questioned. When he talks of “superstition” he <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xv">[<a href="#pb.xv">xv</a>]</span>means primarily Spanish superstition; he refers to a priesthood that still makes millions
every year by the sale of indulgences. If you remember these things, you will, however
you dissent from his teaching in parts, appreciate the burning and unselfish idealism
of the man, and understand why some of us see the brand of Cain on the fair brow of
Spain for extinguishing that idealism in blood.

<h2 class="main">THE BIRTH OF MY IDEALS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The share which I had in the political struggles of the last part of the nineteenth
century put my early convictions to a severe test. I was a revolutionary in the cause
of justice; I was convinced that liberty, equality, and fraternity were the legitimate
fruit to be expected of a republic. Seeing, therefore, no other way to attain this
ideal but a political agitation for a change of the form of government, I devoted
myself entirely to the republican propaganda.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e408src" href="#xd31e408">1</a>
</p>
<p>My relations with D. Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla, who was one of the leading figures in the
revolutionary movement, brought me into contact with a number of the Spanish revolutionaries
and some prominent French agitators, and my intercourse with them led to a sharp disillusion.
I detected in many of them an egoism which they sought hypocritically to conceal,
while the ideals of others, who were more sincere, seemed to me inadequate. In none
of them did I perceive a design to bring about a radical improvement<span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>—a reform which should go to the roots of disorder and afford some security of a perfect
social regeneration.
</p>
<p>The experience I acquired during my fifteen years’ residence at Paris, in which I
witnessed the crises of Boulangism, Dreyfusism, and Nationalism, and the menace they
offered to the Republic, convinced me that the problem of popular education was not
solved; and, if it were not solved in France, there was little hope of Spanish republicanism
settling it, especially as the party had always betrayed a lamentable inappreciation
of the need of a system of general education.
</p>
<p>Consider what the condition of the present generation would be if the Spanish republican
party had, after the banishment of Ruiz Zorrilla [1885], devoted itself to the establishment
of Rationalist schools in connection with each committee, each group of Freethinkers,
or each Masonic lodge; if, instead of the presidents, secretaries, and members of
the committees thinking only of the office they were to hold in the future republic,
they had entered upon a vigorous campaign for the instruction of the people. In the
thirty years that have elapsed considerable progress would have been made in founding
day-schools for children and night-schools for adults.
</p>
<p>Would the general public, educated in this way, be content to send members to Parliament
who would accept an Associations Law presented by the monarchists? Would the people
confine itself to holding meetings to demand a reduction of the price <span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>of bread, instead of resenting the privations imposed on the worker by the superfluous
luxuries of the wealthy? Would they waste their time in futile indignation meetings,
instead of organising their forces for the removal of all unjust privileges?
</p>
<p>My position as professor of Spanish at the Philotechnic Association and in the Grand
Orient of France brought me into touch with people of every class, both in regard
to character and social position; and, when I considered them from the point of view
of their possible influence on the race, I found that they were all bent upon making
the best they could of life in a purely individualist sense. Some studied Spanish
with a view to advancing in their profession, others in order to master Spanish literature
and promote their careers, and others for the purpose of obtaining further pleasure
by travelling in countries where Spanish was spoken.
</p>
<p>No one felt the absurdity of the contradictions between belief and knowledge; hardly
one cared to give a just and rational form to human society, in order that all the
members of each generation might have a proportionate share in the advantages created
by earlier generations. Progress was conceived as a kind of fatalism, independent
of the knowledge and the goodwill of men, subject to vacillations and accidents in
which the conscience and energy of man had no part. The individual, reared in a family
circle, with its inveterate atavism and its traditional illusions maintained by ignorant
mothers, and in the school with something worse than error—the sacramental <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>untruth imposed by men who spoke in the name of a divine revelation—was deformed and
degenerate at his entrance into society; and, if there is any logical relation between
cause and effect, nothing could be expected of him but irrational and pernicious results.
</p>
<p>I spoke constantly to those whom I met with a view to proselytism, seeking to ascertain
the use of each of them for the purpose of my ideal, and soon realised that nothing
was to be expected of the politicians who surrounded Ruiz Zorrilla; they were, in
my opinion, with a few honourable exceptions, impenitent adventurers. This gave rise
to a certain expression which the judicial authorities sought to use to my disadvantage
in circumstances of great gravity and peril. Zorrilla, a man of lofty views and not
sufficiently on his guard against human malice, used to call me an “anarchist” when
he heard me put forward a logical solution of a problem; at all times he regarded
me as a deep radical, opposed to the opportunist views and the showy radicalism of
the Spanish revolutionaries who surrounded and even exploited him, as well as the
French republicans, who held a policy of middle-class government and avoided what
might benefit the disinherited proletariate, on the pretext of distrusting Utopias.
</p>
<p>In a word, during the early years of the restoration there were men conspiring with
Ruiz Zorrilla who have since declared themselves convinced monarchists and conservatives;
and that worthy man, who protested earnestly against the <i lang="fr">coup d’État</i> of January 3, 1874, confided in his false friends, with the result, not <span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>uncommon in the political world, that most of them abandoned the republican party
for the sake of some office. In the end he could count only on the support of those
who were too honourable to sell themselves, though they lacked the logic to develop
his ideas and the energy to carry out his work.
</p>
<p>In consequence of this I restricted myself to my pupils, and selected for my purposes
those whom I thought more appropriate and better disposed. Having now a clear idea
of the aim which I proposed to myself and a certain prestige from my position as teacher
and my expansive character, I discussed various subjects with my pupils when the lessons
were over; sometimes we spoke of Spanish customs, sometimes of politics, religion,
art, or philosophy. I sought always to correct the exaggerations of their judgments,
and to show clearly how mischievous it is to subordinate one’s own judgment to the
dogma of a sect, school, or party, as is so frequently done. In this way I succeeded
in bringing about a certain agreement among men who differed in their creeds and views,
and induced them to master the beliefs which they had hitherto held unquestioningly
by faith, obedience, or sheer indolence. My friends and pupils found themselves happy
in thus abandoning some ancient error and opening their minds to truths which uplifted
and ennobled them.
</p>
<p>A rigorous logic, applied with discretion, removed fanatical bitterness, established
intellectual harmony, and gave, to some extent at least, a progressive disposition
to their wills. Freethinkers who opposed <span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>the Church and rejected the legends of <i>Genesis</i>, the imperfect morality of the gospels, and the ecclesiastical ceremonies; more or
less opportunist republicans or radicals who were content with the futile equality
conferred by the title of citizen, without in the least affecting class distinctions;
philosophers who fancied they had discovered the first cause of things in their metaphysical
labyrinths and established truth in their empty phrases—all were enabled to see the
errors of others as well as their own, and they leaned more and more to the side of
common sense.
</p>
<p>When the further course of my life separated me from these friends and brought on
me an unmerited imprisonment, I received many expressions of confidence and friendship
from them. From all of them I anticipate useful work in the cause of progress, and
I congratulate myself that I had some share in the direction of their thoughts and
endeavours.

<h2 class="main">MLLE. MEUNIER</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among my pupils was a certain Mlle. Meunier, a wealthy old lady with no dependents,
who was fond of travel, and studied Spanish with the object of visiting my country.
She was a convinced Catholic and a very scrupulous observer of the rules of her Church.
To her, religion and morality were the same thing, and unbelief—or “impiety,” as the
faithful say—was an evident sign of vice and crime.
</p>
<p>She detested revolutionaries, and she regarded with impulsive and undiscriminating
aversion every display of popular ignorance. This was due, not only to her education
and social position, but to the circumstance that during the period of the Commune
she had been insulted by children in the streets of Paris as she went to church with
her mother. Ingenuous and sympathetic, without regard to antecedents, accessories,
or consequences, she always expressed her dogmatic convictions without reserve, and
I had many opportunities to open her eyes to the inaccuracy of her opinions.
</p>
<p>In our many conversations I refrained from taking any definite side; so that she did
not recognise me as a partisan of any particular belief, but as a careful <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>reasoner with whom it was a pleasure to confer. She formed so flattering an opinion
of me, and was so solitary, that she gave me her full confidence and friendship, and
invited me to accompany her on her travels. I accepted the offer, and we travelled
in various countries. My conduct and our constant conversation compelled her to recognise
the error of thinking that every unbeliever was perverse and every atheist a hardened
criminal, since I, a convinced atheist, manifested symptoms very different from those
which her religious prejudice had led her to expect.
</p>
<p>She thought, however, that my conduct was exceptional, and reminded me that the exception
proves the rule. In the end the persistency and logic of my arguments forced her to
yield to the evidence, and, when her prejudice was removed, she was convinced that
a rational and scientific education would preserve children from error, inspire men
with a love of good conduct, and reorganise society in accord with the demands of
justice. She was deeply impressed by the reflection that she might have been on a
level with the children who had insulted her if, at their age, she had been reared
in the same conditions as they. When she had given up her belief in innate ideas,
she was greatly preoccupied with the following problem: If a child were educated without
hearing anything about religion, what idea of the Deity would it have on reaching
the age of reason?
</p>
<p>After a while, it seemed to me that we were wasting time if we were not prepared to
go on from words to deeds. To be in possession of an important privilege <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>through the imperfect organisation of society and by the accident of birth, to conceive
ideas of reform, and to remain inactive or indifferent amid a life of pleasure, seemed
to me to incur a responsibility similar to that of a man who refused to lend a hand
to a person whom he could save from danger. One day, therefore, I said to Mlle. Meunier:—
</p>
<p>“Mlle., we have reached a point at which it is necessary to reconsider our position.
The world appeals to us for our assistance, and we cannot honestly refuse it. It seems
to me that to expend entirely on comforts and pleasures resources which form part
of the general patrimony, and which would suffice to establish a useful institution,
is to commit a fraud; and that would be sanctioned neither by a believer nor an unbeliever.
I must warn you, therefore, that you must not count on my company in your further
travels. I owe myself to my ideas and to humanity, and I think that you ought to have
the same feeling now that you have exchanged your former faith for rational principles.”
</p>
<p>She was surprised, but recognised the justice of my decision, and, without other stimulus
than her own good nature and fine feeling, she gave me the funds for the establishment
of an institute of rational education. The Modern School, which already existed in
my mind, was thus ensured of realisation by this generous act.
</p>
<p>All the malicious statements that have been made in regard to this matter—for instance,
that I had to submit to a judicial interrogation—are sheer calumnies. <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>It has been said that I used a power of suggestion over Mlle. Meunier for my own purposes.
This statement, which is as offensive to me as it is insulting to the memory of that
worthy and excellent lady, is absolutely false. I do not need to justify myself; I
leave my vindication to my acts, my life, and the impartial judgment of my contemporaries.
But Mlle. Meunier is entitled to the respect of all men of right feeling, of all those
who have been delivered from the despotism of sect and dogma, who have broken all
connection with error, who no longer submit the light of reason to the darkness of
faith nor the dignity of freedom to the yoke of obedience.
</p>
<p>She believed with honest faith. She had been taught that between the Creator and the
creature there is a hierarchy of intermediaries whom one must obey, and that one must
bow to a series of mysteries contained in the dogmas imposed by a divinely instituted
Church. In that belief she remained perfectly tranquil. The remarks I made and advice
I offered her were not spontaneous commentaries on her belief, but natural replies
to her efforts to convert me; and, from her want of logic, her feeble reasoning broke
down under the strength of my arguments, instead of her persuading me to put faith
before reason. She could not regard me as a tempting spirit, since it was always she
who attacked my convictions; and she was in the end vanquished by the struggle of
her faith and her own reason, which was aroused by her indiscretion in assailing the
faith of one who opposed her beliefs.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span></p>
<p>She now ingenuously sought to exonerate the Communist boys as poor and uneducated
wretches, the offspring of crime, disturbers of the social order on account of the
injustice which, in face of such a disgrace, permits others, equal disturbers of the
social order, to live unproductive lives, enjoy great wealth, exploit ignorance and
misery, and trust that they will continue throughout eternity to enjoy their pleasures
on account of their compliance with the rites of the Church and their works of charity.
The idea of a reward of easy virtue and punishment of unavoidable sin shocked her
conscience and moderated her religious feeling, and, seeking to break the atavistic
chain which so much hampers any attempt at reform, she decided to contribute to the
founding of a useful work which would educate the young in a natural way and in conditions
which would help them to use to the full the treasures of knowledge which humanity
has acquired by labour, study, observation, and the methodical arrangement of its
general conclusions.
</p>
<p>In this way, she thought, with the aid of a supreme intelligence which veils itself
in mystery from the mind of man, or by the knowledge which humanity has gained by
suffering, contradiction, and doubt, the future will be realised; and she found an
inner contentment and vindication of her conscience in the idea of contributing, by
the bestowal of her property, to a work of transcendent importance.

<h2 class="main">I ACCEPT THE RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once I was in possession of the means of attaining my object, I determined to put
my hand to the task without delay.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e482src" href="#xd31e482">1</a> It was now time to give a precise shape to the vague aspiration that had long haunted
my imagination; and to that end, conscious of my imperfect knowledge of the art of
pædagogy, I sought the counsel of others. I had not a great confidence in the official
pædagogists, as they seemed to me to be largely hampered by prejudices in regard to
their subject or other matters, and I looked out for some competent person whose views
and conduct would accord with my ideals. With his assistance I would formulate the
programme of the Modern School which I had already conceived. In my opinion it was
to be, not the perfect type of the future school of a rational state of society, but
a precursor of it, the best possible adaptation of our means; that is to say, an emphatic
rejection of the ancient type of school which still survives, and a careful experiment
in the direction of imbuing the children of the future with the substantial truths
of science.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span></p>
<p>I was convinced that the child comes into the world without innate ideas, and that
during the course of his life he gathers the ideas of those nearest to him, modifying
them according to his own observation and reading. If this is so, it is clear that
the child should receive positive and truthful ideas of all things, and be taught
that, to avoid error, it is essential to admit nothing on faith, but only after experience
or rational demonstration. With such a training the child will become a careful observer,
and will be prepared for all kinds of studies.
</p>
<p>When I had found a competent person, and while the first lines were being traced of
the plan we were to follow, the necessary steps were taken in Barcelona for the founding
of the establishment; the building was chosen and prepared, and the furniture, staff,
advertisements, prospectuses, leaflets, etc., were secured. In less than a year all
was ready, though I was put to great loss through the betrayal of my confidence by
a certain person. It was clear that we should at once have to contend with many difficulties,
not only on the part of those who were hostile to rational education, but partly on
account of a certain class of theorists, who urged on me, as the outcome of their
knowledge and experience, advice which I could only regard as the fruit of their prejudices.
One man, for instance, who was afflicted with a zeal for local patriotism, insisted
that the lessons should be given in Catalan [the dialect of the province of Barcelona],
and would thus confine humanity and the world within the narrow limits of the region
between the <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>Ebro and the Pyrenees. I would not, I told the enthusiast, even adopt Spanish as the
language of the school if a universal language had already advanced sufficiently to
be of practical use. I would a hundred times rather use Esperanto than Catalan.
</p>
<p>The incident confirmed me in my resolution not to submit the settlement of my plan
to the authority of distinguished men who, with all their repute, do not take a single
voluntary step in the direction of reform. I felt the burden of the responsibility
I had accepted, and I endeavoured to discharge it as my conscience directed. Resenting
the marked social inequalities of the existing order as I did, I could not be content
to deplore their effects; I must attack them in their causes, and appeal to the principle
of justice—to that ideal equality which inspires all sound revolutionary feeling.
</p>
<p>If matter is one, uncreated, and eternal—if we live on a relatively small body in
space, a mere speck in comparison with the innumerable globes about us, as is taught
in the universities, and may be learned by the privileged few who share the monopoly
of science—we have no right to teach, and no excuse for teaching, in the primary schools
to which the people go when they have the opportunity, that God made the world out
of nothing in six days, and all the other absurdities of the ancient legends. Truth
is universal, and we owe it to everybody. To put a price on it, to make it the monopoly
of a privileged few, to detain the lowly in systematic ignorance, and—what is worse—impose
on them a dogmatic and <span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>official doctrine in contradiction with the teaching of science, in order that they
may accept with docility their low and deplorable condition, is to me an intolerable
indignity. For my part, I consider that the most effective protest and the most promising
form of revolutionary action consist in giving the oppressed, the disinherited, and
all who are conscious of a demand for justice, as much truth as they can receive,
trusting that it will direct their energies in the great work of the regeneration
of society.
</p>
<p>Hence the terms of the first announcement of the Modern School that was issued to
the public. It ran as follows:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Programme.</span>
</p>
<p>The mission of the Modern School is to secure that the boys and girls who are entrusted
to it shall become well-instructed, truthful, just, and free from all prejudice.
</p>
<p>To that end the rational method of the natural sciences will be substituted for the
old dogmatic teaching. It will stimulate, develop, and direct the natural ability
of each pupil, so that he or she will not only become a useful member of society,
with his individual value fully developed, but will contribute, as a necessary consequence,
to the uplifting of the whole community.
</p>
<p>It will instruct the young in sound social duties, in conformity with the just principle
that “there are no duties without rights, and no rights without duties.”
</p>
<p>In view of the good results that have been obtained abroad by mixed education, and
especially in order to realise the great aim of the Modern School—the <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>formation of an entirely fraternal body of men and women, without distinction of sex
or class—children of both sexes, from the age of five upward, will be received.
</p>
<p>For the further development of its work, the Modern School will be opened on Sunday
mornings, when there will be classes on the sufferings of mankind throughout the course
of history, and on the men and women who have distinguished themselves in science,
art, or the fight for progress. The parents of the children may attend these classes.
</p>
<p>In the hope that the intellectual work of the Modern School will be fruitful, we have,
besides securing hygienic conditions in the institution and its dependencies, arranged
to have a medical inspection of children at their entrance into the school. The result
of this will be communicated to the parents if it is deemed necessary; and others
will be held periodically, in order to prevent the spread of contagious diseases during
the school hours.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>During the week which preceded the opening of the Modern School I invited the representatives
of the press to visit the institution and make it known, and some of the journals
inserted appreciative notices of the work. It may be of historical interest to quote
a few paragraphs from <i lang="es">El Diluvio</i>:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The future is budding in the school. To build on any other foundation is to build
on sand. Unhappily, the school may serve either the purposes of tyranny or the cause
of liberty, and may thus serve either barbarism or civilisation.
</p>
<p>We are therefore pleased to see certain patriots and humanitarians, who grasp the
transcendent importance of this social function, which our Government <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>systematically overlooks, hasten to meet this pressing need by founding a Modern School;
a school which will not seek to promote the interests of sect and to move in the old
ruts, as has been done hitherto, but will create an intellectual environment in which
the new generation will absorb the ideas and the impulses which the stream of progress
unceasingly brings.
</p>
<p>This end can only be attained by private enterprise. Our existing institutions, tainted
with all the vices of the past and weakened by all the trivialities of the present,
cannot discharge this useful function. It is reserved for men of noble mind and unselfish
feeling to open up the new path by which succeeding generations will rise to higher
destinies.
</p>
<p>This has been done, or will be done, by the founders of the modest Modern School which
we have visited at the courteous invitation of its directors and those who are interested
in its development. This school is not a commercial enterprise, like most scholastic
institutions, but a pædagogical experiment, of which only one other specimen exists
in Spain (the Free Institution of Education at Madrid).
</p>
<p>Sr. Salas Antón brilliantly expounded the programme of the school to the small audience
of journalists and others who attended the modest opening-festival, and descanted
on the design of educating children in the <i>whole</i> truth and <i>nothing but</i> the truth, or what is proved to be such. His chief theme was that the founders do
not propose to add one more to the number of what are known as “Lay Schools,” with
their impassioned dogmatism, but a serene observatory, open to the four winds of heaven,
with no cloud darkening the horizon and interposing between the light and the mind
of man.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE EARLY PROGRAMME</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The time had come to think of the inauguration of the Modern School. Some time previously
I had invited a number of gentlemen of great distinction and of progressive sentiments
to assist me with their advice and form a kind of Committee of Consultation. My intercourse
with them at Barcelona was of great value to me, and many of them remained in permanent
relation with me, for which I may express my gratitude. They were of opinion that
the Modern School should be opened with some display—invitation-cards, a circular
to the press, a large hall, music, and oratorical addresses by distinguished Liberal
politicians. It would have been easy to do this, and we would have attracted an audience
of hundreds of people who would have applauded with that momentary enthusiasm which
characterises our public functions. But I was not seduced by the idea. As a Positivist
and an idealist I was convinced that a simple modesty best befitted the inauguration
of a work of reform. Any other method seemed to me disingenuous, a concession to enervating
conventions and to the very evil which I was setting out to reform. The proposal of
the Committee was, therefore, repugnant <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>to my conscience and my sentiments, and I was, in that and all other things relating
to the Modern School, the executive power.
</p>
<p>In the first number of the <i>Bulletin of the Modern School</i>, issued on October 30, 1901, I gave a general exposition of the fundamental principles
of the School, which I may repeat here:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Those imaginary products of the mind, <i>a priori</i> ideas, and all the absurd and fantastical fictions hitherto regarded as truth and
imposed as directive principles of human conduct, have for some time past incurred
the condemnation of reason and the resentment of conscience. The sun no longer merely
touches the tips of the mountains; it floods the valleys, and we enjoy the light of
noon. Science is no longer the patrimony of a small group of privileged individuals;
its beneficent rays more or less consciously penetrate every rank of society. On all
sides traditional errors are being dispelled by it; by the confident procedure of
experience and observation it enables us to attain accurate knowledge and criteria
in regard to natural objects and the laws which govern them. With indisputable authority
it bids men lay aside for ever their exclusivisms and privileges, and it offers itself
as the controlling principle of human life, seeking to imbue all with a common sentiment
of humanity.
</p>
<p>Relying on modest resources, but with a robust and rational faith and a spirit that
will not easily be intimidated, whatever obstacles arise in our path, we have founded
the Modern School. Its aim is to convey, without concession to traditional methods,
an education based on the natural sciences. This new method, though the only sound
and positive <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>method, has spread throughout the civilised world, and has innumerable supporters
of intellectual distinction and lofty principles.
</p>
<p>We are aware how many enemies there are about us. We are conscious of the innumerable
prejudices which oppress the social conscience of our country. This is the outcome
of a medieval, subjective, dogmatic education, which makes ridiculous pretensions
to the possession of an infallible criterion. We are further aware that, in virtue
of the law of heredity, strengthened by the influences of the environment, the tendencies
which are connatural and spontaneous in the young child are still more pronounced
in adolescence. The struggle will be severe, the work difficult; but with a constant
and unwavering will, the sole providence of the moral world, we are confident that
we will win the victory to which we aspire. We will develop living brains, capable
of reacting on our instruction. We will take care that the minds of our pupils will
sustain, when they leave the control of their teachers, a stern hostility to prejudice;
that they will be solid minds, capable of forming their own rational convictions on
every subject.
</p>
<p>This does not mean that we will leave the child, at the very outset of its education,
to form its own ideas. The Socratic procedure is wrong, if it is taken too literally.
The very constitution of the mind, at the commencement of its development, demands
that at this stage the child shall be receptive. The teacher must implant the germs
of ideas. These will, when age and strength invigorate the brain, bring forth corresponding
flowers and fruit, in accordance with the degree of initiative and the characteristic
features of the pupil’s mind.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, we may say that we regard as absurd the widespread notion that
an education based on natural science stunts the organ of the idealist faculty. We
are convinced that the contrary is true. What science does is to correct and direct
it, and give it a wholesome sense of reality. The work of man’s cerebral energy is
to create the <i>ideal</i>, with the aid of art and philosophy. But in order that the ideal shall not degenerate
into fables, or mystic and unsubstantial dreams, and the structure be not built on
sand, it is absolutely necessary to give it a secure and unshakable foundation in
the exact and positive teaching of the natural sciences.
</p>
<p>Moreover, the education of a man does not consist merely in the training of his intelligence,
without having regard to the heart and the will. Man is a complete and unified whole,
in spite of the variety of his functions. He presents various facets, but is at the
bottom a single energy, which sees, loves, and applies a will to the prosecution of
what he has conceived or affected. It is a morbid condition, an infringement of the
laws of the human organism, to establish an abyss where there ought to be a sane and
harmonious continuity. The divorce between thought and will is an unhappy feature
of our time. To what fatal consequences it has led! We need only refer to our political
leaders and to the various orders of social life; they are deeply infected with this
pernicious dualism. Many of them are assuredly powerful enough in respect of their
mental faculties, and have an abundance of ideas; but they lack a sound orientation
and the fine thoughts which science applies to the life of individuals and of peoples.
Their restless egoism and the wish to <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>accommodate their relatives, together with their leaven of traditional sentiments,
form an impermeable barrier round their hearts and prevent the infiltration of progressive
ideas and the formation of that sap of sentiment which is the impelling and determining
power in the conduct of man. Hence the attempt to obstruct progress and put obstacles
in the way of new ideas; hence, as a result of these attempts, the scepticism of multitudes,
the death of nations, and the inevitable despair of the oppressed.
</p>
<p>We regard it as one of the first principles of our pædagogical mission that there
is no such duality of character in any individual—one which sees and appreciates truth
and goodness, and one which follows evil. And, since we take natural science as our
guide in education, a further consequence will be recognised; we shall endeavour to
secure that the intellectual impressions which science conveys to the pupil shall
be converted into the sap of sentiment and shall be intensely loved. When sentiment
is strong it penetrates and diffuses itself through the deepest recesses of a man’s
being, pervading and giving a special colour to his character.
</p>
<p>And as a man’s conduct must revolve within the circle of his character, it follows
that a youth educated in the manner we have indicated will, when he comes to rule
himself, recognise science as the one helpful master of his life.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The school was opened on September 8, 1901, with thirty pupils—twelve girls and eighteen
boys. These sufficed for the purpose of our experiment, and we had no intention of
increasing the number for a time, <span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>so that we might keep a more effective watch on the pupils. The enemies of the new
school would take the first opportunity to criticise our work in co-educating boys
and girls.
</p>
<p>The people present at the opening were partly attracted by the notices of our work
published in the press, and partly consisted of the parents of the pupils and delegates
of various working-class societies who had been invited on account of their assistance
to me. I was supported in the chair by the teachers and the Committee of Consultation,
two of whom expounded the system and aim of the school. In this quiet fashion we inaugurated
a work that was destined to last. We created the Modern, Scientific, and Rational
School, the fame of which soon spread in Europe and America. Time may witness a change
of its name—the “Modern” School—but the description “scientific and rational” will
be more and more fully vindicated.

<h2 class="label"><span class="sc">Chapter V.</span></h2>
<h2 class="main">THE CO-EDUCATION OF THE SEXES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The most important point in our programme of rational education, in view of the intellectual
condition of the country, and the feature which was most likely to shock current prejudices
and habits, was the co-education of boys and girls.
</p>
<p>The idea was not absolutely new in Spain. As a result of necessity and of primitive
conditions, there were villages in remote valleys and on the mountains where some
good-natured neighbour, or the priest or sacristan, used to teach the catechism, and
sometimes elementary letters, to boys and girls in common. In fact, it is sometimes
legally authorised, or at least tolerated, by the State among small populations which
have not the means to pay both a master and mistress. In such cases, either a master
or mistress gives common lessons to boys and girls, as I had myself seen in a village
not far from Barcelona. In towns and cities, however, mixed education was not recognised.
One read sometimes of the occurrence of it in foreign countries, but no one proposed
to adopt it in Spain, where such a proposal would have been deemed an innovation of
the most utopian character.
</p>
<p>Knowing this, I refrained from making any public <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>propaganda on the subject, and confined myself to private discussion with individuals.
We asked every parent who wished to send a boy to the school if there were girls in
the family, and it was necessary to explain to each the reasons for co-education.
Wherever we did this, the result was satisfactory. If we had announced our intention
publicly, it would have raised a storm of prejudice. There would have been a discussion
in the press, conventional feeling would have been aroused, and the fear of “what
people would say”—that paralysing obstacle to good intentions—would have been stronger
than reason. Our project would have proved exceedingly difficult, if not impossible.
Whereas, proceeding as we did, we were able to open with a sufficient number of boys
and girls, and the number steadily increased, as the <i>Bulletin</i> of the school shows.
</p>
<p>In my own mind, co-education was of vital importance. It was not merely an indispensable
condition of realising what I regard as the ideal result of rational education; it
was the ideal itself, initiating its life in the Modern School, developing progressively
without any form of exclusion, inspiring a confidence of attaining our end. Natural
science, philosophy, and history unite in teaching, in face of all prejudice to the
contrary, that man and woman are two complementary aspects of human nature, and the
failure to recognise this essential and important truth has had the most disastrous
consequences.
</p>
<p>In the second number of the <i>Bulletin</i>, therefore, I published a careful vindication of my ideas:—
<span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Mixed education (I said) is spreading among civilised nations. In many places it has
already had excellent results. The principle of this new scheme of education is that
children of both sexes shall receive the same lessons; that their minds shall be developed,
their hearts purified, and their wills strengthened in precisely the same manner;
that the sexes shall be in touch with each other from infancy, so that woman shall
be, not in name only, but in reality and truth, the companion of man.
</p>
<p>A venerable institution which dominates the thoughts of our people declares, at one
of the most solemn moments of life, when, with ceremonious pomp, man and woman are
united in matrimony, that woman is the companion of man. These are hollow words, void
of sense, without vital and rational significance in life, since what we witness in
the Christian Church, in Catholicism particularly, is the exact opposite of this idea.
Not long ago a Christian woman of fine feeling and great sincerity complained bitterly
of the moral debasement which is put upon her sex in the bosom of the Church: “It
would be impious audacity for a woman to aspire in the Church even to the position
of the lowest sacristan.”
</p>
<p>A man must suffer from ophthalmia of the mind not to see that, under the inspiration
of Christianity, the position of woman is no better than it was under the ancient
civilisations; it is, indeed, worse, and has aggravating circumstances. It is a conspicuous
fact in our modern Christian society that, as a result and culmination of our patriarchal
development, the woman does not belong to herself; she is neither more nor less than
an adjunct of man, subject constantly to his absolute dominion, bound to him—it may
be—by chains of gold. Man has made her <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>a perpetual minor. Once this was done, she was bound to experience one of two alternatives:
man either oppresses and silences her, or treats her as a child to be coaxed—according
to the mood of the master. If at length we note in her some sign of the new spirit,
if she begins to assert her will and claim some share of independence, if she is passing,
with irritating slowness, from the state of slave to the condition of a respected
ward, she owes it to the redeeming spirit of science, which is dominating the customs
of races and the designs of our social rulers.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The work of man for the greater happiness of the race has hitherto been defective;
in future it must be a joint action of the sexes; it is incumbent on both man and
woman, according to the point of view of each. It is important to realise that, in
face of the purposes of life, man is neither inferior nor (as we affect to think)
superior to woman. They have different qualities, and no comparison is possible between
diverse things.
</p>
<p>As many psychologists and sociologists observe, the human race displays two fundamental
aspects. Man typifies the dominion of thought and of the progressive spirit; woman
bears in her moral nature the characteristic note of intense sentiment and of the
conservative spirit. But this view of the sexes gives no encouragement whatever to
the ideas of reactionaries. If the predominance of the conservative element and of
the emotions is ensured in woman by natural law, this does not make her the less fitted
to be the companion of man. She is not prevented by <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>the constitution of her nature from reflecting on things of importance, nor is it
necessary that she should use her mind in contradiction to the teaching of science
and absorb all kinds of superstitions and fables. The possession of a conservative
disposition does not imply that one is bound to crystallise in a certain stage of
thought, or that one must be obsessed with prejudice in all that relates to reality.
</p>
<p>“To conserve” merely means “to retain,” to keep what has been given us, or what we
have ourselves produced. The author of <i>The Religion of the Future</i> says, referring to woman in this respect: “The conservative spirit may be applied
to truth as well as to error; it all depends what it is you conserve. If woman is
instructed in philosophical and scientific matters, her conservative power will be
to the advantage, not to the disadvantage, of progressive thought.”
</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is pointed out that woman is emotional. She does not selfishly
keep to herself what she receives; she spreads abroad her beliefs, her ideas, and
all the good and evil that form her moral treasures. She insists on sharing them with
all those who are, by the mysterious power of emotion, identified with her. With exquisite
art, with invariable unconsciousness, her whole moral physiognomy, her whole soul,
so to say, impresses itself on the soul of those she loves.
</p>
<p>If the first ideas implanted in the mind of the child by the teacher are germs of
truth and of positive knowledge; if the teacher himself is in touch with the scientific
spirit of the time, the result will be good <span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>from every point of view. But if a man be fed in the first stage of his mental development
with fables, errors, and all that is contrary to the spirit of science, what can be
expected of his future? When the boy becomes a man he will be an obstacle to progress.
The human conscience is in infancy of the same natural texture as the bodily organism;
it is tender and pliant. It readily accepts what comes to it from without. In the
course of time this plasticity gives place to rigidity; it loses its pliancy and becomes
relatively fixed. From that time the ideas communicated to it by the mother will be
encrusted and identified with the youth’s conscience.
</p>
<p>The acid of the more rational ideas which the youth acquires by social intercourse
or private study may in cases relieve the mind of the erroneous ideas implanted in
childhood. But what is likely to be the practical outcome of this transformation of
the mind in the sphere of conduct? We must not forget that in most cases the emotions
associated with the early ideas remain in the deeper folds of the heart. Hence it
is that we find in so many men such a flagrant and lamentable antithesis between the
thought and the deed, the intelligence and the will; and this often leads to an eclipse
of good conduct and a paralysis of progress.
</p>
<p>This primary sediment which we owe to our mothers is so tenacious and enduring—it
passes so intimately into the very marrow of our being—that even energetic characters,
which have effected a sincere reform of mind and will, have the mortification of discovering
<span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>this Jesuitical element, derived from their mothers, when they turn to make an inventory
of their ideas.
</p>
<p>Woman must not be restricted to the home. The sphere of her activity must go out far
beyond her home: it must extend to the very confines of society. But in order to ensure
a helpful result from her activity we must not restrict the amount of knowledge we
communicate to her; she must learn, both in regard to quantity and quality, the same
things as man. When science enters the mind of woman it will direct her rich vein
of emotion, the characteristic element of her nature, the glad harbinger of peace
and happiness among men.
</p>
<p>It has been said that woman represents <i>continuity</i>, and man represents change: man is the individual, woman is the species. Change,
however, would be useless, fugitive, and inconstant, with no solid foundation of reality,
if the work of woman did not strengthen and consolidate the achievements of man. The
individual, as such, is the flower of a day, a thing of ephemeral significance in
life. Woman, who represents the species, has the function of retaining within the
species the elements which improve its life, and to discharge this function adequately
she needs scientific instruction.
</p>
<p>Humanity will advance more rapidly and confidently in the path of progress and increase
its resources a hundredfold if it combines the ideas acquired by science with the
emotional strength of woman. Ribot observes that an idea is merely an idea, an act
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>intelligence, incapable of producing or doing anything, unless it is accompanied by
an emotional state, a motive element. Hence it is conceived as a scientific truth
that, to the advantage of progress, an idea does not long remain in a purely contemplative
condition when it appears. This is obviated by associating the idea with emotion and
love, which do not fail to convert it into vital action.
</p>
<p>When will all this be accomplished? When shall we see the marriage of ideas with the
impassioned heart of woman? From that date we shall have a moral matriarchate among
civilised nations. Then, on the one hand, humanity, considered in the home circle,
will have the proper teacher to direct the new generations in the sense of the ideal;
and, on the other hand, it will have an apostle and enthusiastic propagandist who
will impress the value of liberty on the minds of men and the need of co-operation
upon the peoples of the world.

<h2 class="label"><span class="sc">Chapter VI.</span></h2>
<h2 class="main">CO-EDUCATION OF THE SOCIAL CLASSES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There must be a co-education of the different social classes as well as of the two
sexes. I might have founded a school giving lessons gratuitously; but a school for
poor children only would not be a rational school, since, if they were not taught
submission and credulity as in the old type of school, they would have been strongly
disposed to rebel, and would instinctively cherish sentiments of hatred.
</p>
<p>There is no escape from the dilemma. There is no middle term in the school for the
disinherited class alone; you have either a systematic insistence, by means of false
teaching, on error and ignorance, or hatred of those who domineer and exploit. It
is a delicate point, and needs stating clearly. Rebellion against oppression is merely
a question of statics, of equilibrium. Between one man and another who are perfectly
equal, as is said in the immortal first clause of the famous Declaration of the French
Revolution (“Men are born and remain free and equal in rights”), there can be no social
inequality. If there is such inequality, some will tyrannise, the others protest and
hate. Rebellion is a levelling tendency, and to that extent natural and rational,
however much it may be <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>discredited by justice and its evil companions, law and religion.
</p>
<p>I venture to say quite plainly: the oppressed and the exploited have a right to rebel,
because they have to reclaim their rights until they enjoy their full share in the
common patrimony. The Modern School, however, has to deal with children, whom it prepares
by instruction for the state of manhood, and it must not anticipate the cravings and
hatreds, the adhesions and rebellions, which may be fitting sentiments in the adult.
In other words, it must not seek to gather fruit until it has been produced by cultivation,
nor must it attempt to implant a sense of responsibility until it has equipped the
conscience with the fundamental conditions of such responsibility. Let it teach the
children to be men; when they are men, they may declare themselves rebels against
injustice.
</p>
<p>It needs very little reflection to see that a school for rich children only cannot
be a rational school. From the very nature of things it will tend to insist on the
maintenance of privilege and the securing of their advantages. The only sound and
enlightened form of school is that which co-educates the poor and the rich, which
brings the one class into touch with the other in the innocent equality of childhood,
by means of the systematic equality of the rational school.
</p>
<p>With this end in view I decided to secure pupils of every social rank and include
them in a common class, adopting a system accommodated to the circumstances <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>of the parents or guardians of the children; I would not have a fixed and invariable
fee, but a kind of sliding scale, with free lessons for some and different charges
for others. I later published the following article on the subject in the <i>Bulletin</i> (May 10, 1905):—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Our friend D.&nbsp;R.&nbsp;C. gave a lecture last Sunday at the Republican Club on the subject
of “Modern Pædagogy,” explaining to his audience what we mean by modern education
and what advantages society may derive from it. As I think that the subject is one
of very great interest and most proper to receive public attention, I offer the following
reflections and considerations on it. It seems to me that the lecturer was happy in
his exposition of the ideal, but not in the suggestions he made with a view to realising
it, nor in bringing forward the schools of France and Belgium as models to be imitated.
</p>
<p>Señor C., in fact, relies upon the State, upon Parliament or municipalities, for the
building, equipment, and management of scholastic institutions. This seems to me a
great mistake. If modern pædagogy means an effort towards the realisation of a new
and more just form of society; if it means that we propose to instruct the rising
generation in the causes which have brought about and maintain the lack of social
equilibrium; if it means that we are anxious to prepare the race for better days,
freeing it from religious fiction and from all idea of submission to an inevitable
socio-economic inequality; we cannot entrust it to the State nor to other official
organisms which necessarily maintain existing privileges and support the laws which
at present consecrate the exploitation of <span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>one man by another, the pernicious source of the worst abuses.
</p>
<p>Evidence of the truth of this is so abundant that any person can obtain it by visiting
the factories and workshops and other centres of paid workers, by inquiring what is
the manner of life of those in the higher and those in the lower social rank, by frequenting
what are called courts of justice, and by asking the prisoners in our penal institutions
what were the motives for their misconduct. If all this does not suffice to prove
that the State favours those who are in possession of wealth and frowns on those who
rebel against injustice, it may be useful to notice what has happened in Belgium.
Here, according to Señor C., the government is so attentive to education and conducts
it so excellently that private schools are impossible. In the official schools, he
says, the children of the rich mingle with the children of the poor, and one may at
times see the child of wealthy parents arm in arm with a poor and lowly companion.
It is true, I admit, that children of all classes may attend the Belgian schools;
but the instruction that is given in them is based on the supposed eternal necessity
for a division of rich and poor, and on the principle that social harmony consists
in the fulfilment of the laws.
</p>
<p>It is natural enough that the masters should like to see this kind of education given
on every side. It is a means of bringing to reason those who might one day be tempted
to rebel. Not long ago, in Brussels and other Belgian towns, the sons of the rich,
armed and organised in national troops, shot down the sons of the poor who were claiming
universal suffrage. On the other hand, my acquaintance with the quality of Belgian
education differs <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>considerably from that of the lecturer. I have before me various issues of a Belgian
journal (<i lang="fr">L’Exprèss de Liège</i>) which devotes an article to the subject, entitled “The Destruction of our National
System of Education.” The facts given are, unfortunately, very similar to the facts
about education in Spain, though in this country there has been a great development
of education by religious orders, which is, as everybody knows, the systematisation
of ignorance. In fine, it is not for nothing that a violently clerical government
rules in Belgium.
</p>
<p>As to the modern education which is given in French schools, we may say that not a
single one of the books used in them serves the purpose of a really secular education.
On the very day on which Señor C. was lecturing in Gracia the Parisian journal <i lang="fr">L’Action</i> published an article, with the title “How Secular Morality is Taught,” in regard
to the book <i lang="fr">Recueil de maximes et pensées morales</i>, and quoted from it certain ridiculously anachronistic ideas which offend the most
elementary common sense.
</p>
<p>We shall be asked, What are we to do if we cannot rely on the aid of the State, of
Parliament, or municipalities? We must appeal to those whose interest it is to bring
about a reform; to the workers, in the first place, then to the cultivated and privileged
people who cherish sentiments of justice. They may not be numerous, but there are
such. I am personally acquainted with several. The lecturer complained that the civic
authorities were so dilatory in granting the reforms that are needed. I feel sure
that he would do better not to waste his time on them, but appeal directly to the
working class.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>The field has been well prepared. Let him visit the various working men’s societies,
the Republican Fraternities, the Centres of Instruction, the Workers’ Athenæums, and
all the bodies which are working for reform,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e682src" href="#xd31e682">1</a> and let him give ear to the language of truth, the exhortations to union and courage.
Let him observe the attention given to the problem of rational and scientific instruction,
a kind of instruction which shows the injustice of privilege and the possibility of
reforms. If individuals and societies continue thus to combine their endeavours to
secure the emancipation of those who suffer—for it is not the workers only who suffer—Señor
C. may rest assured of a positive, sound, and speedy result, while whatever may be
obtained of the government will be dilatory, and will tend only to stupefy, to confuse
ideas, and to perpetuate the domination of one class over another.</p>

<h2 class="main">SCHOOL HYGIENE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In regard to hygiene we are, in Spain, dominated by the abominable ideas of the Catholic
Church. Saint Aloysius and Saint Benedict J. Labré are not the only, or the most characteristic,
saints in the list of the supposed citizens of the kingdom of heaven, but they are
the most popular with the masters of uncleanliness. With such types of perfection,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e694src" href="#xd31e694">1</a> in an atmosphere of ignorance, cleverly and maliciously sustained by the clergy and
the middle-class Liberals, it was to be expected that the children who would come
to our school would be wanting in cleanliness; dirt is traditional in their world.
</p>
<p>We began a discreet and systematic campaign against it, showing the children how a
dirty person or object inspires repugnance, and how cleanliness attracts esteem and
sympathy; how one instinctively moves towards the cleanly person and away from the
dirty and malodorous; and how we should be pleased to win the regard of those who
see us and ashamed to excite their disgust.
</p>
<p>We then explained cleanliness as an aspect of <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>beauty, and uncleanliness as a part of ugliness; and we at length entered expressly
into the province of hygiene, pointing out that dirt was a cause of disease and a
constant possible source of infection and epidemic, while cleanliness was one of the
chief conditions of health. We thus soon succeeded in disposing the children in favour
of cleanliness, and making them understand the scientific principles of hygiene.
</p>
<p>The influence of these lessons spread to their families, as the new demands of the
children disturbed traditional habits. One child would ask urgently for its feet to
be washed, another would ask to be bathed, another wanted a brush and powder for its
teeth, another new clothes or boots, and so on. The poor mothers, burdened with their
daily tasks, sometimes crushed by the hardness of the circumstances in which their
life was passed, and probably under the influence of religious teaching, endeavoured
to stop their petitions; but in the end the new life introduced into the home by the
child triumphed, a welcome presage of the regeneration which rational education will
one day accomplish.
</p>
<p>I entrusted the expounding of the principles of scholastic hygiene to competent men,
and Dr. Martínez Vargas and others wrote able and detailed articles on the subject
in the <i>Bulletin</i>. Other articles were written on the subject of games and play, on the lines of modern
pædagogy.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e707src" href="#xd31e707">2</a>

<h2 class="main">THE TEACHERS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The choice of teachers was another point of great difficulty. The tracing of a programme
of rational instruction once accomplished, it remained to choose teachers who were
competent to carry it out, and I found that in fact no such persons existed. We were
to illustrate once more that a need creates its own organs.
</p>
<p>Certainly there were plenty of teachers. Teaching, though not very lucrative, is a
profession by which a man can support himself. There is not a universal truth in the
popular proverb which says of an unfortunate man: “He is hungrier than a schoolmaster.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e719src" href="#xd31e719">1</a> The truth is that in many parts of Spain the schoolmaster forms part of the local
governing clique, with the priest, the doctor, the shopkeeper, and the money-lender
(who is often one of the richest men in the place, though he contributes least to
its welfare). The master receives a municipal salary, and has a certain influence
which may at times secure material advantages. In larger towns the master, if he is
not <span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>content with his salary, may give lessons in private schools, where, in accord with
the provincial institute, he prepares young men for the University. Even if he does
not obtain a position of distinction, he lives as well as the generality of his fellow
townsmen.
</p>
<p>There are, moreover, teachers in what are called “secular schools”—a name imported
from France, where it arose because the schooling was formerly exclusively clerical
and conducted by religious bodies. This is not the case in Spain; however Christian
the teaching is, it is always given by lay masters. However, the Spanish lay teachers,
inspired by sentiments of freethought and political radicalism, were rather anti-Catholic
and anti-clerical than Rationalist, in the best sense of the word.
</p>
<p>Professional teachers have to undergo a special preparation for the task of imparting
scientific and rational instruction. This is difficult in all cases, and is sometimes
rendered impossible by the difficulties caused by habits of routine. On the other
hand, those who had had no pædagogical experience, and offered themselves for the
work out of pure enthusiasm for the idea, stood in even greater need of preparatory
study. The solution of the problem was very difficult, because there was no other
place but the rational school itself for making this preparation.
</p>
<p>The excellence of the system saved us. Once the Modern School had been established
by private initiative, with a firm determination to be guided by the ideal, the difficulties
began to disappear. Every dogmatic imposition was detected and rejected, <span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>every excursion or deviation in the direction of metaphysics was at once abandoned,
and experience gradually formed a new and salutary pædagogical science. This was due,
not merely to my zeal and vigilance, but to my earliest teachers, and to some extent
to the naive expressions of the pupils themselves. We may certainly say that if a
need creates an organ, the organ speedily meets the need.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in order to complete my work, I established a Rationalist Normal School
for the education of teachers, under the direction of an experienced master and with
the co-operation of the teachers in the Modern School. In this a number of young people
of both sexes were trained, and they worked excellently until the despotic authorities,
yielding to our obscure and powerful enemies, put a stop to our work, and flattered
themselves that they had destroyed it for ever.

<h2 class="main">THE REFORM OF THE SCHOOL</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There are two ways open to those who seek to reform the education of children. They
may seek to transform the school by studying the child and proving scientifically
that the actual scheme of instruction is defective, and must be modified; or they
may found new schools in which principles may be directly applied in the service of
that ideal which is formed by all who reject the conventions, the cruelty, the trickery,
and the untruth which enter into the bases of modern society.
</p>
<p>The first method offers great advantages, and is in harmony with the evolutionary
conception which men of science regard as the only effective way of attaining the
end. They are right in theory, as we fully admit. It is evident that the progress
of psychology and physiology must lead to important changes in educational methods;
that the teachers, being now in a better position to understand the child, will make
their teaching more in conformity with natural laws. I further grant that this evolution
will proceed in the direction of greater liberty, as I am convinced that violence
is the method of ignorance, and that the educator who is really worthy of the name
will <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>gain everything by spontaneity; he will know the child’s needs, and will be able to
promote its development by giving it the greatest possible satisfaction.
</p>
<p>In point of fact, however, I do not think that those who are working for the regeneration
of humanity have much to hope from this side. Rulers have always taken care to control
the education of the people; they know better than any that their power is based entirely
on the school, and they therefore insist on retaining their monopoly of it. The time
has gone by when rulers could oppose the spread of instruction and put limits to the
education of the masses. Such a policy was possible formerly because economic life
was consistent with general ignorance, and this ignorance facilitated despotism. The
circumstances have changed, however. The progress of science and our repeated discoveries
have revolutionised the conditions of labour and production. It is no longer possible
for the people to remain ignorant; education is absolutely necessary for a nation
to maintain itself and make headway against its economic competitors. Recognising
this, the rulers have sought to give a more and more complete organisation to the
school, not because they look to education to regenerate society, but because they
need more competent workers to sustain industrial enterprises and enrich their cities.
Even the most reactionary rulers have learned this lesson; they clearly understand
that the old policy was dangerous to the economic life of nations, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>that it was necessary to adapt popular education to the new conditions.
</p>
<p>It would be a serious mistake to think that the ruling classes have not foreseen the
danger to themselves of the intellectual development of the people, and have not understood
that it was necessary to change their methods. In fact, their methods have been adapted
to the new conditions of life; they have sought to gain control of the ideas which
are in course of evolution. They have endeavoured to preserve the beliefs on which
social discipline had been grounded, and to give to the results of scientific research
and the ideas involved in them a meaning which will not be to the disadvantage of
existing institutions; and it is this that has induced them to assume control of the
school. In every country the governing classes, which formerly left the education
of the people to the clergy, as these were quite willing to educate in a sense of
obedience to authority, have now themselves undertaken the direction of the schools.
</p>
<p>The danger to them consists in the stimulation of the human mind by the new spectacle
of life and the possible rise of thoughts of emancipation in the depths of their hearts.
It would have been folly to struggle against the evolving forces; the effect would
be only to inflame them, and, instead of adhering to earlier methods of government,
they would adopt new and more effective methods. It did not require any extraordinary
genius to discover the solution. The course of events itself suggested to those who
were in power the way in which they were to meet the <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>difficulties which threatened; they built schools, they sought generously to extend
the sphere of education, and if there were at one point a few who resisted this impulse—as
certain tendencies favoured one or other of the political parties—all soon understood
that it was better to yield, and that the best policy was to find some new way of
defending their interests and principles. There were then sharp struggles for the
control of the schools, and these struggles continue to-day in every civilised country;
sometimes the republican middle-class triumphs, sometimes the clergy. All parties
appreciate the importance of the issue, and they shrink from no sacrifice to win the
victory. “The school” is the cry of every party. The public good must be recognised
in this zeal. Everybody seeks to raise himself and improve his condition by education.
In former times it might have been said: “Those people want to keep thee in ignorance
in order the better to exploit thee: we want to see thee educated and free.” That
is no longer possible; schools of all kinds rise on every side.
</p>
<p>In regard to this general change of ideas among the governing classes as to the need
of schools, I may state certain reasons for distrusting their intentions and doubting
the efficacy of the means of reform which are advocated by certain writers. As a rule,
these reformers care little about the social significance of education; they are men
who eagerly embrace scientific truth, but eliminate all that is foreign to the object
of their studies. They are patiently endeavouring <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>to understand the child, and are eager to know—though their science is young, it must
be remembered—what are the best methods to promote its intellectual development.
</p>
<p>This kind of professional indifference is, in my opinion, very prejudicial to the
cause they seek to serve. I do not in the least think them insensible of the realities
of the social world, and I know that they believe that the public welfare will be
greatly furthered by their labours. “Seeking to penetrate the secrets of the life
of man,” they reflect, “and unravelling the normal process of his physical and psychic
development, we shall direct education into a channel which will be favourable to
the liberation of energy. We are not immediately concerned with the reform of the
school, and indeed we are unable to say exactly what lines it should follow. We will
proceed slowly, knowing that, from the very nature of things, the reform of the school
will result from our research. If you ask us what are our hopes, we will grant that,
like you, we foresee a revolution in the sense of a placing of the child and humanity
under the direction of science; yet even in this case we are persuaded that our work
makes for that object, and will be the speediest and surest means of promoting it.”
</p>
<p>This reasoning is evidently logical. No one could deny this, yet there is a considerable
degree of fallacy in it, and we must make this clear. If the ruling classes have the
same ideas as the reformers, if they are really impelled by a zeal for the continuous
reorganisation of society until poverty is at last eliminated, <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>we might recognise that the power of science is enough to improve the lot of peoples.
Instead of this, however, we see clearly that the sole aim of those who strive to
attain power is the defence of their own interests, their own advantage, and the satisfaction
of their personal desires. For some time now we have ceased to accept the phrases
with which they disguise their ambitions. It is true that there are some in whom we
may find a certain amount of sincerity, and who imagine at times that they are impelled
by a zeal for the good of their fellows. But these become rarer and rarer, and the
positivism of the age is very severe in raising doubts as to the real intentions of
those who govern us.
</p>
<p>And just as they contrived to adapt themselves when the necessity arose, and prevented
education from becoming a danger, they also succeeded in organising the school in
accord with the new scientific ideas in such a way that nothing should endanger their
supremacy. These ideas are difficult to accept, and one needs to keep a sharp look-out
for successful methods and see how things are arranged so as to avoid verbal traps.
How much has been, and is, expected of education! Most progressive people expect everything
of it, and, until recent years, many did not understand that instruction alone leads
to illusions. Much of the knowledge actually imparted in schools is useless; and the
hope of reformers has been void because the organisation of the school, instead of
serving an ideal purpose, has become one of the most powerful instruments of servitude
in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>hands of the ruling class. The teachers are merely conscious or unconscious organs
of their will, and have been trained on their principles. From their tenderest years,
and more drastically than anybody, they have endured the discipline of authority.
Very few have escaped this despotic domination; they are generally powerless against
it, because they are oppressed by the scholastic organisation to such an extent that
they have nothing to do but obey. It is unnecessary here to describe that organisation.
One word will suffice to characterise it—Violence. The school dominates the children
physically, morally, and intellectually, in order to control the development of their
faculties in the way desired, and deprives them of contact with nature in order to
modify them as required. This is the explanation of the failure; the eagerness of
the ruling class to control education and the bankruptcy of the hopes of reformers.
“Education” means in practice domination or domestication. I do not imagine that these
systems have been put together with the deliberate aim of securing the desired results.
That would be a work of genius. But things have happened just as if the actual scheme
of education corresponded to some vast and deliberate conception; it could not have
been done better. To attain it teachers have inspired themselves solely with the principles
of discipline and authority, which always appeal to social organisers; such men have
only one clear idea and one will—the children must learn to obey, to believe, and
to think according to the prevailing social dogmas. If this were the aim, education
could not be other <span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>than we find it to-day. There is no question of promoting the spontaneous development
of the child’s faculties, or encouraging it to seek freely the satisfaction of its
physical, intellectual, and moral needs. There is question only of imposing ready-made
ideas on it, of preventing it from ever thinking otherwise than is required for the
maintenance of existing social institutions—of making it, in a word, an individual
rigorously adapted to the social mechanism.
</p>
<p>It cannot be expected that this kind of education will have any influence on the progress
of humanity. I repeat that it is merely an instrument of domination in the hands of
the ruling classes, who have never sought to uplift the individual, and it is quite
useless to expect any good from the schools of the present day. What they have done
up to the present they will continue to do in the future. There is no reason whatever
why they should adopt a different system; they have resolved to use education for
their purposes, and they will take advantage of every improvement of it. If only they
preserve the spirit of the school and the authoritative discipline which rules it,
every innovation will tend to their advantage. For this they will keep a constant
watch, and take care that their interests are secured.
</p>
<p>I would fix the attention of my readers on this point: the whole value of education
consists in respect for the physical, intellectual, and moral faculties of the child.
As in science, the only possible demonstration is demonstration by facts; education
is not worthy of the name unless it be <span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>stripped of all dogmatism, and unless it leaves to the child the direction of its
powers and is content to support them in their manifestations. But nothing is easier
than to alter this meaning of education, and nothing more difficult than to respect
it. The teacher is always imposing, compelling, and using violence; the true educator
is the man who does not impose his own ideas and will on the child, but appeals to
its own energies.
</p>
<p>From this we can understand how easily education is conducted, and how light is the
task of those who seek to dominate the individual. The best conceivable methods become
in their hands so many new and more effective means of despotism. Our ideal is that
of science; we appeal to it in demanding the power to educate the child by fostering
its development and procuring a satisfaction of its needs as they manifest themselves.
</p>
<p>We are convinced that the education of the future will be entirely spontaneous. It
is plain that we cannot wholly realise this, but the evolution of methods in the direction
of a broader comprehension of life and the fact that all improvement involves the
suppression of violence indicate that we are on solid ground when we look to science
for the liberation of the child.
</p>
<p>Is this the ideal of those who actually control the scholastic system? Is this what
they propose to bring about? Are they eager to abandon violence? Only in the sense
that they employ new and more effective methods to attain the same end—that is to
<span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>say, the formation of individuals who will accept all the conventions, all the prejudices,
and all the untruths on which society is based.
</p>
<p>We do not hesitate to say that we want men who will continue unceasingly to develop;
men who are capable of constantly destroying and renewing their surroundings and renewing
themselves; men whose intellectual independence is their supreme power, which they
will yield to none; men always disposed for things that are better, eager for the
triumph of new ideas, anxious to crowd many lives into the one life they have. Society
fears such men; you cannot expect it to set up a system of education which will produce
them.
</p>
<p>What, then, is our mission? What is the policy we must adopt in order to contribute
to the reform of the school?
</p>
<p>Let us follow closely the work of the experts who are engaged in the study of the
child, and let us endeavour to find a way of applying their principles to the education
we seek to establish, aiming at an increasingly complete emancipation of the individual.
But how are we to do this? By putting our hand energetically to the work, by promoting
the establishment of new schools in which, as far as possible, there shall rule this
spirit of freedom which, we feel, will colour the whole education of the future.
</p>
<p>We have already had proof that it leads to excellent results. We can destroy whatever
there is in the actual school that savours of violence, all the artificial devices
by which the children are estranged from <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>nature and life, the intellectual and moral discipline which has been used to impose
ready-made thoughts, all beliefs which deprave and enervate the will. Without fear
of injury we may place the child in a proper and natural environment, in which it
will find itself in contact with all that it loves, and where vital impressions will
be substituted for the wearisome reading of books. If we do no more than this, we
shall have done much towards the emancipation of the child.
</p>
<p>In such an environment we may freely make use of the data of science and work with
profit. It is true that we could not realise all our hopes; that often we shall find
ourselves compelled, from lack of knowledge, to use the wrong means. But we shall
be sustained by the confident feeling that, without having achieved our entire aim,
we shall have done a great deal more than is being done by the actual school. I would
rather have the free spontaneity of a child who knows nothing than the verbal knowledge
and intellectual deformation of one that has experienced the existing system of education.
</p>
<p>What we have sought to do in Barcelona is being done by others in various places.
All of us saw that the work was possible. Dedicate yourself to it at once. We do not
hope that the studies of children will be suspended that we may regenerate the school.
Let us apply what we know, and go on learning and applying. A scheme of rational education
is already possible, and in such schools as we advocate the children may develop freely
according to their aspirations. <span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>Let us endeavour to improve and extend the work.
</p>
<p>Those are our aims. We know well the difficulties we have to face; but we have made
a beginning in the conviction that we shall be assisted in our task by those who work
in their various spheres to deliver men from the dogmas and conventions which secure
the prolongation of the present unjust arrangement of society.

<h2 class="main">NO REWARD OR PUNISHMENT</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Rational education is, above all things, a means of defence against error and ignorance.
To ignore truth and accept absurdities is, unhappily, a common feature in our social
order; to that we owe the distinction of classes and the persistent antagonism of
interests. Having admitted and practised the co-education of boys and girls, of rich
and poor—having, that is to say, started from the principle of solidarity and equality—we
are not prepared to create a new inequality. Hence in the Modern School there will
be no rewards and no punishments; there will be no examinations to puff up some children
with the flattering title of “excellent,” to give others the vulgar title of “good,”
and make others unhappy with a consciousness of incapacity and failure.
</p>
<p>These features of the existing official and religious schools, which are quite in
accord with their reactionary environment and aim, cannot, for the reasons I have
given, be admitted into the Modern School. Since we are not educating for a specific
purpose, we cannot determine the capacity or incapacity of the child. When we teach
a science, or art, or trade, or some subject requiring special conditions, <span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>an examination may be useful, and there may be reason to give a diploma or refuse
one; I neither affirm nor deny it. But there is no such specialism in the Modern School.
The characteristic note of the school, distinguishing it even from some which pass
as progressive models, is that in it the faculties of the children shall develop freely
without subjection to any dogmatic patron, not even to what it may consider the body
of convictions of the founder and teachers; every pupil shall go forth from it into
social life with the ability to be his own master and guide his own life in all things.
</p>
<p>Hence, if we were rationally prevented from giving prizes, we could not impose penalties,
and no one would have dreamed of doing so in our school if the idea had not been suggested
from without. Sometimes parents came to me with the rank proverb, “Letters go in with
blood,” on their lips, and begged me to punish their children. Others who were charmed
with the precocious talent of their children wanted to see them shine in examinations
and exhibit medals. We refused to admit either prizes or punishments, and sent the
parents away. If any child were conspicuous for merit, application, laziness, or bad
conduct, we pointed out to it the need of accord, or the unhappiness of lack of accord,
with its own welfare and that of others, and the teacher might give a lecture on the
subject. Nothing more was done, and the parents were gradually reconciled to the system,
though they often had to be corrected in their errors and prejudices by their own
children.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>Nevertheless, the old prejudice was constantly recurring, and I saw that I had to
repeat my arguments with the parents of new pupils. I therefore wrote the following
article in the <i>Bulletin</i>:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The conventional examinations which we usually find held at the end of a scholastic
year, to which our fathers attached so much importance, have had no result at all;
or, if any result, a bad one. These functions and their accompanying solemnities seem
to have been instituted for the sole purpose of satisfying the vanity of parents and
the selfish interests of many teachers, and in order to put the children to torture
before the examination and make them ill afterwards. Each father wants his child to
be presented in public as one of the prodigies of the college, and regards him with
pride as a learned man in miniature. He does not notice that for a fortnight or so
the child suffers exquisite torture. As things are judged by external appearances,
it is not thought that there is any real torture, as there is not the least scratch
visible on the skin.…
</p>
<p>The parent’s lack of acquaintance with the natural disposition of the child, and the
iniquity of putting it in false conditions so that its intellectual powers, especially
in the sphere of memory, are artificially stimulated, prevent the parent from seeing
that this measure of personal gratification may, as has happened in many cases, lead
to illness and to the moral, if not the physical, death of the child.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, the majority of teachers, being mere stereotypers of ready-made
phrases and mechanical inoculators, rather than <i>moral fathers</i> of their pupils, are concerned in these examinations <span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>with their own personality and their economic interests. Their object is to let the
parents and the others who are present at the public display see that, under their
guidance, the child has learned a good deal, that its knowledge is greater in quantity
and quality than could have been expected of its tender years and in view of the short
time that it has been under the charge of this very skilful teacher.
</p>
<p>In addition to this wretched vanity, which is satisfied at the cost of the moral and
physical life of the child, the teachers are anxious to elicit compliments from the
parents and the rest of the audience, who know nothing of the real state of things,
as a kind of advertisement of the prestige of their particular school.
</p>
<p>Briefly, we are inexorably opposed to holding public examinations. In our school everything
must be done for the advantage of the pupil. Everything that does not conduce to this
end must be recognised as opposed to the natural spirit of positive education. Examinations
do no good, and they do much harm to the child. Besides the illness of which we have
already spoken, the nervous system of the child suffers, and a kind of temporary paralysis
is inflicted on its conscience by the immoral features of the examination; the vanity
provoked in those who are placed highest, envy and humiliation, grave obstacles to
sound growth, in those who have failed, and in all of them the germs of most of the
sentiments which go to the making of egoism.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>In a later number of the <i>Bulletin</i> I found it necessary to return to the subject:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We frequently receive letters from Workers’ <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>Educational Societies and Republican Fraternities asking that the teachers shall chastise
the children in our schools. We ourselves have been disgusted, during our brief excursions,
to find material proofs of the fact which is at the base of this request; we have
seen children on their knees, or in other attitudes of punishment.
</p>
<p>These irrational and atavistic practices must disappear. Modern pædagogy entirely
discredits them. The teachers who offer their services to the Modern School, or ask
our recommendation to teach in similar schools, must refrain from any moral or material
punishment, under penalty of being disqualified permanently. Scolding, impatience,
and anger ought to disappear with the ancient title of “master.” In free schools all
should be peace, gladness, and fraternity. We trust that this will suffice to put
an end to these practices, which are most improper in people whose sole ideal is the
training of a generation fitted to establish a really fraternal, harmonious, and just
state of society.</p>

<h2 class="main">THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND THE LIBRARY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In setting out to establish a rational school for the purpose of preparing children
for their entry into the free solidarity of humanity, the first problem that confronted
us was the selection of books. The whole educational luggage of the ancient system
was an incoherent mixture of science and faith, reason and unreason, good and evil,
human experience and revelation, truth and error; in a word, totally unsuited to meet
the new needs that arose with the formation of a new school.
</p>
<p>If the school has been from remote antiquity equipped not for teaching in the broad
sense of communicating to the rising generation the gist of the knowledge of previous
generations, but for teaching on the basis of authority and the convenience of the
ruling classes, for the purpose of making children humble and submissive, it is clear
that none of the books hitherto used would suit us. But the severe logic of this position
did not at once convince me. I refused to believe that the French democracy, which
worked so zealously for the separation of Church and State, incurred the anger of
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>clericals, and adopted obligatory secular instruction, would resign itself to a semi-education
or a sophisticated education. I had, however, to yield to the evidence, against my
prejudice. I first read a large number of works in the French code of secular instruction,
and found that God was replaced by the State, Christian virtue by civic duty, religion
by patriotism, submission to the king, the aristocracy, and the clergy by subservience
to the official, the proprietor, and the employer. Then I consulted an eminent Freethinker
who held high office in the Ministry of Public Instruction, and, when I had told him
my desire to see the books they used, which I understood to be purged of traditional
errors, and explained my design and ideal to him, he told me frankly that they had
nothing of the sort; all their books were, more or less cleverly and insidiously,
tainted with untruth, which is the indispensable cement of social inequality. When
I further asked if, seeing that they had replaced the decaying idol of deity by the
idol of oligarchic despotism, they had not at least some book dealing with the origin
of religion, he said that there was none; but he knew one which would suit me—Malvert’s
<i>Science and Religion</i>. In point of fact, this was already translated into Spanish, and was used as a reading-book
in the Modern School, with the title <i>Origin of Christianity</i>.
</p>
<p>In Spanish literature I found several works written by a distinguished author, of
some eminence in science, who had produced them rather in the interest of the publishers
than with a view to the education of <span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>children. Some of these were at first used in the Modern School, but, though one could
not accuse them of error, they lacked the inspiration of an ideal and were poor in
method. I communicated with this author with a view to interesting him in my plans
and inducing him to write books for me, but his publishers held him to a certain contract
and he could not oblige me.
</p>
<p>In brief, the Modern School was opened before a single work had been chosen for its
library, but it was not long before the first appeared—a brilliant book by Jean Grave,
which has had a considerable influence on our schools. His work, <i>The Adventures of Nono</i>, is a kind of poem in which a certain phase of the happier future is ingeniously
and dramatically contrasted with the sordid realities of the present social order;
the delights of the land of Autonomy are contrasted with the horrors of the kingdom
of Argirocracy. The genius of Grave has raised the work to a height at which it escapes
the strictures of the sceptical and conservative; he has depicted the social evils
of the present truthfully and without exaggeration. The reading of the book enchanted
the children, and the profundity of his thought suggested many opportune comments
to the teachers. In their play the children used to act scenes from Autonomy, and
their parents detected the causes of their hardships in the constitution of the kingdom
of Argirocracy.
</p>
<p>It was announced in the <i>Bulletin</i> and other journals that prizes were offered for the best manuals of rational instruction,
but no writers came forward. I confine <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>myself to recording the fact without going into the causes of it. Two books were afterwards
adopted for reading in school. They were not written for school, but they were translated
for the Modern School and were very useful. One was called <i>The Note Book</i>, the other <i>Colonisation and Patriotism</i>. Both were collections of passages from writers of every country on the injustices
connected with patriotism, the horrors of war, and the iniquity of conquest. The choice
of these works was vindicated by the excellent influence they had on the minds of
the children, as we shall see from the little essays of the children which appeared
in the <i>Bulletin</i>, and the fury with which they were denounced by the reactionary press and politicians.
</p>
<p>Many think that there is not much difference between secular and rationalist education,
and in various articles and propagandist speeches the two were taken to be synonymous.
In order to correct this error I published the following article in the <i>Bulletin</i>:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The word <i>education</i> should not be accompanied by any qualification. It means simply the need and duty
of the generation which is in the full development of its powers to prepare the rising
generation and admit it to the patrimony of human knowledge. This is an entirely rational
ideal, and it will be fully realised in some future age, when men are wholly freed
from their prejudices and superstitions.
</p>
<p>In our efforts to realise this ideal we find ourselves confronted with religious education
and political education: to these we must oppose rational and scientific instruction.
The type of religious education <span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>is that given in the clerical and convent schools of all countries; it consists of
the smallest possible quantity of useful knowledge and a good deal of Christian doctrine
and sacred history. Political education is the kind established some time ago in France,
after the fall of the Empire, the object of which is to exalt patriotism and represent
the actual public administration as the instrument of the common welfare.
</p>
<p>Sometimes the qualification <i>free</i> or <i>secular</i> is applied abusively and maliciously to education, in order to distract or alienate
public opinion. Orthodox people, for instance, call <i>free schools</i> certain schools which they establish in opposition to the really free tendency of
modern pædagogy; and many are called <i>secular schools</i> which are really political, patriotic, and anti-humanitarian.
</p>
<p>Rational education is lifted above these illiberal forms. It has, in the first place,
no regard to religious education, because science has shown that the story of creation
is a myth and the gods legendary; and therefore religious education takes advantage
of the credulity of the parents and the ignorance of the children, maintaining the
belief in a supernatural being to whom people may address all kinds of prayers. This
ancient belief, still unfortunately widespread, has done a great deal of harm, and
will continue to do so as long as it persists. The mission of education is to show
the child, by purely scientific methods, that the more knowledge we have of natural
products, their qualities, and the way to use them, the more industrial, scientific,
and artistic commodities we shall have for the support and comfort of life, and men
and women will issue in larger numbers from our schools with a determination to <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>cultivate every branch of knowledge and action, under the guidance of reason and the
inspiration of science and art, which will adorn life and reform society.
</p>
<p><i>We will not, therefore, lose our time praying to an imaginary God for things which
our own exertions alone can procure.</i>
</p>
<p>On the other hand, our teaching has nothing to do with politics. It is our work to
form individuals in the full possession of all their faculties, while politics would
subject their faculties to other men. While religion has, with its divine power, created
a positively abusive power and retarded the development of humanity, political systems
also retard it by encouraging men to depend for everything on the will of others,
on what are supposed to be men of a superior character—on those, in a word, who, from
tradition or choice, exercise the profession of politics. It must be the aim of the
rational schools to show the children that there will be tyranny and slavery as long
as one man depends upon another, to study the causes of the prevailing ignorance,
to learn the origin of all the traditional practices which give life to the existing
social system, and to direct the attention of the pupils to these matters.
</p>
<p><i>We will not, therefore, lose our time seeking from others what we can get for ourselves.</i>
</p>
<p>In a word, our business is to imprint on the minds of the children the idea that their
condition in the social order will improve in proportion to their knowledge and to
the strength they are able to develop; and that the era of general happiness will
be the more sure to dawn when they have discarded all religious and other superstitions,
which have up to the present done so much harm. On that account there are no rewards
or punishments in our schools; no alms, no <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>medals or badges in imitation of the religious and patriotic schools, which might
encourage the children to believe in talismans instead of in the individual and collective
power of beings who are conscious of their ability and knowledge.
</p>
<p>Rational and scientific knowledge must persuade the men and women of the future that
they have to expect nothing from any privileged being (fictitious or real); and that
they may expect all that is reasonable from themselves and from a freely organised
and accepted social order.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>I then appealed in the <i>Bulletin</i> and the local press to scientific writers who were eager for the progress of the
race to supply us with text-books on these lines. They were, I said, “to deliver the
minds of the pupils from all the errors of our ancestors, encourage them in the love
of truth and beauty, and keep from them the authoritarian dogmas, venerable sophisms,
and ridiculous conventionalities which at present disgrace our social life.” A special
note was added in regard to the teaching of arithmetic:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The way in which arithmetic has hitherto been generally taught has made it a powerful
instrument for impressing the pupils with the false ideals of the capitalist règime
which at present presses so heavily on society. The Modern School, therefore, invites
essays on the subject of the reform of the teaching of arithmetic, and requests those
friends of rational and scientific instruction who are especially occupied with mathematics
to draw up a series of easy and practical problems, in which there shall be no reference
to wages, economy, and profit. These exercises must deal with agricultural and industrial
production, <span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>the just distribution of the raw material and the manufactured articles, the means
of communication, the transport of merchandise, the comparison of human labour with
mechanical, the benefits of machinery, public works, etc. In a word, the Modern School
wants a number of problems showing what arithmetic really ought to be—the science
of the social economy (taking the word “economy” in its etymological sense of “good
distribution”).
</p>
<p>The exercises will deal with the four fundamental operations (integrals, decimals,
and fractions), the metrical system, proportion, compounds and alloys, the squares
and cubes of numbers, and the extraction of square and cube roots. As those who respond
to this appeal are, it is hoped, inspired rather with the ideal of a right education
of children than with the desire of profit, and as we wish to avoid the common practice
in such circumstances, we shall not appoint judges or offer any prizes. The Modern
School will publish the Arithmetic which best serves its purpose, and will come to
an amicable agreement with the author as to his fee.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>A later note in the <i>Bulletin</i> was addressed to teachers:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We would call the attention of all who dedicate themselves to the noble ideal of the
rational teaching of children and the preparation of the young to take a fitting share
in life to the announcements of a <i>Compendium of Universal History</i> by Clémence Jacquinet, and <i>The Adventures of Nono</i> by Jean Grave, which will be found on the cover.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e932src" href="#xd31e932">1</a> The <span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>works which the Modern School has published or proposes to publish are intended for
all free and rational teaching institutions, centres of social study, and parents,
who resent the intellectual restrictions which dogma of all kinds—religious, political,
and social—imposes in order to maintain privilege at the expense of the ignorant.
All who are opposed to Jesuitism and to conventional lies, and to the errors transmitted
by tradition and routine, will find in our publications truth based upon evidence.
As we have no desire of profit, the price of the works represents almost their intrinsic
value or material cost; if there is any profit from the sale of them, it will be spent
upon subsequent publications.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>In a later number of the <i>Bulletin</i> (No. 6, second year) the distinguished geographer Elisée Reclus wrote, at my request,
a lengthy article on the teaching of geography. In a letter which Reclus afterwards
wrote me from the Geographical Institute at Brussels, replying to my request that
he should recommend a text-book, he said that there was “no text-book for the teaching
of geography in elementary schools”; he “did not know one that was not tainted with
religious or patriotic poison, or, what is worse, administrative routine.” He recommended
that the teachers should use no manual in the Modern School, which he cordially commended
(February 26, 1903).
<span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the following number (7) of the <i>Bulletin</i> I published the following note on the origin of Christianity:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The older pædagogy, the real, if unavowed, aim of which was to impress children with
the uselessness of knowledge, in order that they might be reconciled to their hard
conditions and seek consolation in a supposed future life, used reading-books in the
elementary school which swarmed with stories, anecdotes, accounts of travels, gems
of classical literature, etc. There was a good deal of error mixed with what was sound
and useful in this, and the aim was not just. The mystical idea predominated, representing
that a relation could be established between a Supreme Being and men by means of priests,
and this priesthood was the chief foundation of the existence of both the privileged
and the disinherited, and the cause of much of the evil that they endured.
</p>
<p>Among other books of this class, all tainted with the same evil, we remember one which
inserted an academic discourse, a marvel of Spanish eloquence, in praise of the Bible.
The gist of it is expressed in the barbarous declaration of Omar when he condemned
the Library of Alexandria to the flames: “The whole truth is contained in the sacred
book. If those other books are true, they are superfluous; if they are not true, they
should be burned.”
</p>
<p>The Modern School, which seeks to form free minds, with a sense of responsibility,
fitted to experience a complete development of their powers, which is the one aim
of life, must necessarily adopt a very different kind of reading-book, in harmony
with its method of teaching. For this reason, as it teaches established <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>truth and is interested in the struggle between light and darkness, it has deemed
it necessary to produce a critical work which will enlighten the mind of the child
with positive facts. These may not be appreciated in childhood, but will later, in
manhood, when the child takes its place in social life and in the struggle against
the errors, conventions, hypocrisies, and infamies which conceal themselves under
the cloak of mysticism. This work reminds us that our books are not merely intended
for children; they are destined also for the use of the Adult Schools which are being
founded on every side by associations of workers, Freethinkers, Co-operators, social
students, and other progressive bodies who are eager to correct the illiteracy of
our nation, and remove that great obstacle to progress.
</p>
<p>We believe that the section of Malvert’s work (<i>Science and Religion</i>) which we have entitled “The Origin of Christianity” will be useful for this purpose.
It shows the myths, dogmas, and ceremonies of the Christian religion in their original
form; sometimes as exoteric symbols concealing a truth known to the initiated, sometimes
as adaptations of earlier beliefs, imposed by sheer routine and preserved by malice.
As we are convinced and have ample evidence of the usefulness of our work, we offer
it to the public with the hope that it will bear the fruit which we anticipate. We
have only to add that certain passages which are unsuitable for children have been
omitted; the omissions are indicated, and adults may consult the passages in the complete
edition.</p>

<h2 class="main">SUNDAY LECTURES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Modern School did not confine itself to the instruction of children. Without for
a moment sacrificing its predominant character and its chief object, it also undertook
the instruction of the people. We arranged a series of public lectures on Sundays,
and they were attended by the pupils and other members of their families, and a large
number of workers who were anxious to learn.
</p>
<p>The earlier lectures were wanting in method and continuity, as we had to employ lecturers
who were quite competent in regard to their own subjects, but gave each lecture without
regard to what preceded or followed. On other occasions, when we had no lecturer,
we substituted useful readings. The general public attended assiduously, and our advertisements
in the Liberal press of the district were eagerly scanned.
</p>
<p>In view of these results, and in order to encourage the disposition of the general
public, I held a consultation with Dr. Andrés Martínez Vargas and Dr. Odón de Buen,
Professors at the Barcelona University, on the subject of creating a popular university
in the Modern School. In this the science which is given—or, rather, sold—by the State
to a privileged <span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>few in the universities should be given gratuitously to the general public, by way
of restitution, as every human being has a right to know, and science, which is produced
by observers and workers of all ages and countries, ought not to be restricted to
a class.
</p>
<p>From that time the lectures became continuous and regular, having regard to the different
branches of knowledge of the two lecturers. Dr. Martínez Vargas expounded physiology
and hygiene, and Dr. Odón de Buen geography and natural science, on alternate Sundays,
until we began to be persecuted. Their teaching was eagerly welcomed by the pupils
of the Modern School, and the large audiences of mixed children and adults. One of
the Liberal journals of Barcelona, in giving an account of the work, spoke of the
function as “the scientific Mass.”
</p>
<p>The eternal light-haters, who maintain their privileges on the ignorance of the people,
were greatly exasperated to see this centre of enlightenment shining so vigorously,
and did not delay long to urge the authorities, who were at their disposal, to extinguish
it brutally. For my part, I resolved to put the work on the firmest foundation I could
conceive.
</p>
<p>I recall with the greatest pleasure that hour we devoted once a week to the confraternity
of culture. I inaugurated the lectures on December 15, 1901, when Don Ernesto Vendrell
spoke of Hypatia as a martyr to the ideals of science and beauty, the victim of the
fanatical Bishop Cyril of Alexandria. Other lectures were given on subsequent Sundays,
as I said, until, on October 5, 1902, the lectures were organised <span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>in regular courses of science. On that day Dr. Andrés Martínez Vargas, Professor of
the Faculty of Medicine (child diseases) at Barcelona University, gave his first lecture.
He dealt with the hygiene of the school, and expounded its principles in plain terms
adapted to the minds of his hearers. Dr. Odón de Buen, Professor of the Faculty of
Science, dealt with the usefulness of the study of natural history.
</p>
<p>The press was generally in sympathy with the Modern School, but when the programme
of the third scholastic year appeared some of the local journals, the <i lang="es">Noticiero Universal</i> and the <i lang="es">Diario de Barcelona</i>, broke out. Here is a passage that deserves recording as an illustration of the way
in which conservative journals dealt with progressive subjects:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We have seen the prospectus of an educational centre established in this city, which
professes to have nothing to do with “dogmas and systems.” It proposes to liberate
everybody from “authoritarian dogmas, venerable sophisms, and ridiculous conventions.”
It seems to us that this means that the first thing to do is to tell the boys and
girls—it is a mixed school—that there is no God, an admirable way of forming good
children, especially young women who are destined to be wives and mothers.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The writer continues in this ironical manner for some time, and ends as follows:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">This school has the support of a professor of Natural Science (Dr. Odón de Buen) and
another of the Faculty of Medicine. We do not name the latter, as there may be some
mistake in including <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>him among the men who lend their support to such a work.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>These insidious clerical attacks were answered by the anti-clerical journals of Barcelona
at the time.

<h2 class="main">THE RESULTS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At the beginning of the second scholastic year I once more drew up a programme. Let
us, I said, confirm our earlier programme; vindicated by results, approved in theory
and practice, the principle which from the first informed our work and governs the
Modern School is now unshakable.
</p>
<p><i>Science is the sole mistress of our life.</i> Inspired with this thought, the Modern School proposes to give the children entrusted
to it <i>a mental vitality of their own</i>, so that when they leave our control they will continue to be the mortal enemies
of all kinds of prejudices and will form their own ideas, individually and seriously,
on all subjects.
</p>
<p>Further, as education does not consist merely in the training of the mind, but must
include the emotions and the will, we shall take the utmost care in the training of
the child that its intellectual impressions are converted into the sap of sentiment.
When this attains a certain degree of intensity, it spreads through the whole being,
colouring and refining the individual character. And as the conduct of the youth revolves
entirely in the sphere of character, he must learn to adopt science as the sole mistress
of his life.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>To complete our principle we must state that we are enthusiastically in favour of
mixed education, so that, having the same education, the woman may become the real
companion of man, and work with him for the regeneration of society. This task has
hitherto been confined to man; it is time that the moral influence of woman was enlisted
in it. Science will illumine and guide her rich vein of sentiment, and utilise her
character for the welfare of the race. Knowing that the chief need in this country
is a knowledge of natural science and hygiene, the Modern School intends to help to
supply it. In this it has the support of Dr. de Buen and Dr. Vargas, who lecture,
alternately, on their respective subjects.
</p>
<p>On June 30, 1903, I published in the <i>Bulletin</i> the following declaration:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We have now passed two years in expounding our principles, justifying them by our
practice, and enjoying the esteem of all who have co-operated in our work. We do not
see in this any other triumph than that we are able to confirm confidently all that
we have proclaimed. We have overcome the obstacles which were put in our way by interest
and prejudice, and we intend to persevere in it, counting always on that progressive
comradeship which dispels the darkness of ignorance with its strong light. We resume
work next September, after the autumn vacation. We are delighted to be able to repeat
what we said last year. The Modern School and its <i>Bulletin</i> renew their life, for they have filled, with some measure of satisfaction, a deeply-felt
need. Without making promises or programmes, we will persevere to the limit of our
powers.</p>
</blockquote><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span></p>

</p>
<p>At the beginning of the third year I published with special pleasure the following
article in the <i>Bulletin</i> on the progress of the School:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">On the eighth of the present month we opened the new scholastic year. A large number
of pupils, their relatives, and members of the general public who were in sympathy
with our work and lectures, filled the recently enlarged rooms, and, before the commencement
of the function, inspected the collections which give the school the appearance of
a museum of science. The function began with a short address from the director, who
formally declared the opening of the third year of school life, and said that, as
they now had more experience and were encouraged by <span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>success, they would carry out energetically the ideal of the Modern School.
</p>
<p>Dr. de Buen congratulated us on the enlargement of the School, and supported its aims.
Education should, he said, reflect nature, as knowledge can only consist in our perception
of what actually exists. On the part of his children, who study at the School and
live in the neighbourhood, he paid a tribute to the good-comradeship among the pupils,
with whom they played and studied in a perfectly natural way. He said that even in
orthodox education, or rather on the part of the professors engaged in it, there were,
for all its archaic features, certain tendencies similar to those embodied in the
Modern School. This might be gathered from his own presence, and that of Dr. Vargas
and other professors. He announced that there was already a similar school at Guadalajara,
or that one would shortly be opened there, built by means of a legacy left for the
purpose by a humanitarian. He wished to contribute to the redemption of children and
their liberation from ignorance and superstition; and he expressed a hope and very
strong wish that wealthy people would, at their death, restore their goods in this
way to the social body, instead of leaving them to secure an imaginary happiness beyond
the grave.
</p>
<p>Dr. Martínez Vargas maintained, against all who thought otherwise, that the purely
scientific and rational education given in the Modern School is the proper basis of
instruction; no better can be conceived for maintaining the relations of the children
with their families and society, and it is the only way to form, morally and intellectually,
the men of the future. He was glad to hear that the scholastic hygiene which had been
practised in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span>Modern School during the previous two years, involving a periodical examination of
the children, and expounded in the public lectures, had received the solemn sanction
of the Hygienic Congress lately held at Brussels.
</p>
<p>Going on to resume his lectures, and as a means of enforcing oral instruction by visual
perception, he exhibited a series of lantern-slides illustrating various hygienic
exercises, certain types of disease, unhealthy organs, etc., which the speaker explained
in detail. An accident to the lantern interrupted the pictures; but the professor
continued his explanations, speaking of the mischievous effects of corsets, the danger
of microbic infection by trailing dresses or by children playing with soil, insanitary
houses and workshops, etc., and promised to continue his medical explanations during
the coming year.
</p>
<p>The audience expressed its pleasure at the close of the meeting, and the sight of
the great joy of the pupils was some consolation amid the hardships of the present,
and a good augury for the future.</p>

<h2 class="main">A DEFENSIVE CHAPTER</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Our programme for the third scholastic year (1903–4) was as follows:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">To promote the progressive evolution of childhood by avoiding all anachronistic practices,
which are merely obstacles placed by the past to any real advance towards the future,
is, in sum, the predominant aim of the Modern School. Neither dogmas nor systems,
moulds which confine vitality to the narrow exigencies of a transitory form of society,
will be taught. Only solutions approved by the facts, theories accepted by reason,
and truths confirmed by evidence, shall be included in our lessons, so that each mind
shall be trained to control a will, and truths shall irradiate the intelligence, and,
when applied in practice, benefit the whole of humanity without any unworthy and disgraceful
exclusiveness.
</p>
<p>Two years of success are a sufficient guarantee to us. They prove, in the first place,
the excellence of mixed education, the brilliant result—the triumph, we would almost
say—of an elementary common sense over prejudice and tradition. As we think it advisable,
especially that the child may know what is happening about it, that physical and natural
science and hygiene should be taught, the Modern School will continue to have the
services of Dr. de <span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>Buen and Dr. Vargas. They will lecture on alternate Sundays, from eleven to twelve,
on their respective subjects in the school-room. These lectures will complete and
further explain the classes in science held during the week.
</p>
<p>It remains only to say that, always solicitous for the success of our work of reform,
we have enriched our scholastic material by the acquisition of new collections which
will at once assist the understanding and give an attractiveness to scientific knowledge;
and that, as our rooms are now not large enough for the pupils, we have acquired other
premises in order to have more room and give a favourable reply to the petitions for
admission which we have received.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The publication of this programme attracted the attention of the reactionary press,
as I said. In order to give them a proof of the logical strength of the position of
the Modern School, I inserted the following article in the <i>Bulletin</i>:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Modern pædagogy, relieved of traditions and conventions, must raise itself to the
height of the rational conception of man, the actual state of knowledge, and the consequent
ideal of mankind. If from any cause whatever a different tendency is given to education,
and the master does not do his duty, it would be just to describe him as an impostor;
education must not be a means of dominating men for the advantage of their rulers.
Unhappily, this is exactly what happens. Society is organised, not in response to
a general need and for the realisation of an ideal, but as an institution with a strong
determination to maintain its primitive forms, defending them vigorously against every
reform, however reasonable it may be.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span></p>
<p>This element of immobility gives the ancient errors the character of sacred beliefs,
invests them with great prestige and a dogmatic authority, and arouses conflicts and
disturbances which deprive scientific truths of their due efficacy or keep them in
suspense. Instead of being enabled to illumine the minds of all and realise themselves
in institutions and customs of general utility, they are unhappily restricted to the
sphere of a privileged few. The effect is that, as in the days of the Egyptian theocracy,
there is an esoteric doctrine for the cultivated and an exoteric doctrine for the
lower classes—the classes destined to labour, defence, and misery.
</p>
<p>On this account we set aside the mystic and mythical doctrine, the domination and
spread of which only befits the earlier ages of human history, and embrace scientific
teaching, according to its evidence. This is at present restricted to the narrow sphere
of the intellectuals, or is at the most accepted in secret by certain hypocrites who,
so that their position may not be endangered, make a public profession of the contrary.
Nothing could make this absurd antagonism clearer than the following parallel, in
which we see the contrast between the imaginative dreams of the ignorant believer
and the rational simplicity of the scientist:—

<p>The Bible contains the annals of the heavens, the earth, and the human race; like
the Deity himself, it contains all that was, is, and will be. On its first page we
read of the beginning of time and of things, and on <span class="pageNum" id="pb83a">[<a href="#pb83a">83</a>]</span>its last page the end of time and of things. It begins with <i>Genesis</i>, which is an idyll, and ends with <i>Revelation</i>, which is a funeral chant. <i>Genesis</i> is as beautiful as the fresh breeze which sweeps over the world; as the first dawn
of light in the heavens; as the first flower that opens in the meadows; as the first
word of love spoken by men; as the first appearance of the sun in the east. <i>Revelation</i> is as sad as the last palpitation of nature; as the last ray of the sun; as the last
breath of a dying man. And between the funeral chant and the idyll there pass in succession
before the eyes of God all generations and all peoples. The tribes and the patriarchs
go by; the republics and the magistrates; the monarchies and their kings; the empires
and their emperors. Babylon and all its abominations go by; Nineveh and all its pomps;
Memphis and its priests; Jerusalem and its prophets and temple; Athens and its arts
and heroes; Rome and its diadem of conqueror of the world. Nothing lasts but God;
all else passes and dies, like the froth that tips the wave.

<p>A prodigious book, which mankind began to read three and thirty centuries ago, and
of which, if it read all day and night, it would not exhaust the wealth. A prodigious
book in which all was calculated before the science of arithmetic was invented; in
which the origin of language is told without any knowledge of philology; in which
the revolutions of the stars are described without any knowledge of astronomy; in
which history is recorded without any documents of history; in which the laws of nature
are unveiled without any knowledge of physics. A prodigious book, that sees everything
and knows everything; that knows the thoughts hidden in the hearts of men and those
in the mind of God; that sees what is happening in the abysses of the sea and in the
bowels of the earth; that records or foretells all the catastrophes of nations, and
in which are accumulated all the treasures of mercy, of justice, and of vengeance.
A book, in fine, which, when the heavens are folded like a gigantic fan, and the earth
<span class="pageNum" id="pb85a">[<a href="#pb85a">85</a>]</span>sinks, and the sun withdraws its light, and the stars are extinguished, will remain

<td class="xd31e1269 cellRight cellTop cellBottom"><span class="sc">Anthropism.</span>
<p>One of the main supports of the reactionary system is what we may call “anthropism.”
I designate by this term that powerful and world-wide group of erroneous opinions
which opposes the human organism <span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>to the whole of the rest of nature, and represents it as the preordained end of organic
creation, an entity essentially distinct from it, a god-like being. Closer examination
of this group of ideas shows it to be made up of three different dogmas, which we
may distinguish as the <i>anthropocentric</i>, the <i>anthropomorphic</i>, and the <i>anthropolatrous</i>.
</p>
<p>1. The <i>anthropocentric</i> dogma culminates in the idea that man is the preordained centre and aim of all terrestrial
life—or, in a wider sense, of the whole universe. As this error is extremely conducive
to man’s interest, and as it is intimately connected with the creation-myth of the
three great Mediterranean religions, and with the dogmas of the Mosaic, Christian,
and Mohammedan theologies, it still dominates the greater part of the civilised world.
</p>
<p>2. The <i>anthropomorphic</i> dogma, also, is connected with the creation-myth of the three aforesaid religions
and of many others. It likens the creation and control of the world by God to the
artificial creation of an able engineer or mechanic, and to the administration of
<span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>a wise ruler. God, as creator, sustainer, and ruler of the world, is thus represented
after a purely human fashion in his thought and work. Hence it follows that man in
turn is god-like. “God made man to his own image and likeness.” The older, naive theology
is pure “homotheism,” attributing human shape, flesh, and blood to the gods. It is
more intelligible than the modern mystic theosophy which adores a personal God as
an invisible—properly speaking, gaseous—being, yet makes him think, speak, and act
in human fashion; it offers us the paradoxical picture of a gaseous vertebrate.
</p>
<p>3. The <i>anthropolatric</i> dogma naturally results from this comparison of the activity of God and man; it ends
in the apotheosis of human nature. A further result is the belief in the personal
immortality of the soul, and the dualistic dogma of the twofold nature of man, whose
“immortal” soul is conceived as the temporary inhabitant of a mortal frame. Thus these
three anthropistic dogmas, variously adapted to the respective professions of the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span>different religions, came at length to be vested with extraordinary importance, and
proved to be the source of the most dangerous errors.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1329src" href="#xd31e1329">2</a>

<p>In face of this antagonism, maintained by ignorance and self-interest, positive education,
which proposes to teach truths that issue in practical justice, must arrange and systematise
the established results of natural research, communicate them to children, and thus
prepare the way for a more equitable state of society, in which, as an exact expression
of sociology, it must work for the benefit of all as well as of the individual. Moses,
or whoever was the author of <i>Genesis</i>, and all the dogmatisers, with their six days of creation out of nothing after the
Creator has passed an eternity in doing nothing, must give place to Copernicus, who
showed the revolution of the planets round the sun; to Galileo, who proclaimed that
the sun, not the earth, is the centre of the planetary universe; to Columbus and others
who, believing the earth to be a sphere, set out in search of other peoples, and gave
a practical basis to the doctrine of human brotherhood; to Linnæus and Cuvier, the
founders of natural history; to Laplace, the inventor of the established cosmogony;
to Darwin, the author of the evolutionary doctrine, which explains the formation of
species by natural selection; and to all who, by means of observation and experiment,
have discredited the supposed <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>revelation, and tell us the real nature of the universe, the earth, and life.
</p>
<p>Against the evils engendered by generations sunk in ignorance and superstition, from
which so many are now delivered, only to fall into an anti-social scepticism, the
best remedy, without excluding others, is to instruct the rising generation in purely
humanist principles and in the positive and rational knowledge provided by science.
Women educated thus will be mothers in the true sense of the word, not transmitters
of traditional superstitions; they will teach their children integrity of life, the
dignity of life, social solidarity, instead of a medley of outworn and sterile dogmas
and submission to illegitimate hierarchies. Men thus emancipated from mystery, miracle,
and distrust of themselves and their fellows, and convinced that they were born, not
to die, as the wretched teaching of the mystics says, but to live, will hasten to
bring about such social conditions as will give to life its greatest possible development.
In this way, preserving the memory of former generations and other frames of mind
as a lesson and a warning, we will once for all close the religious period, and enter
definitely into that of reason and nature.</p>

<p>In June, 1904, the <i>Bulletin</i> published the following figures in regard to the attendance at school. At that time
the publications of the Modern School were in use in thirty-two other schools throughout
the country, and its influence was thus felt in Seville and Malaga, Tarragona and
Cordova, and other towns, as well as Barcelona and the vicinity. The number of scholars
in our schools was also steadily rising, as the following table shows:—

<h2 class="main">THE INGENUOUSNESS OF THE CHILD</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the <i>Bulletin</i> of September 30, 1903, we published the work of the pupils in the various classes
of the Modern School, which had been read on the closing day of the second scholastic
year. In these writings, in which the children are requested to apply their dawning
judgment to some particular subject, the influence of mind over the inexpert, ingenuous
reasoning power, inspired by the sentiment of justice, is more apparent than the observance
of rules. The judgments are not perfect from the logical point of view, only because
the child has not the knowledge necessary for the formation of a perfectly sound opinion.
This is the opposite of what we usually find, as opinions are generally founded only
on prejudice arising from traditions, interests, and dogmas.
</p>
<p>A boy of twelve, for instance, gave the following principle for judging the value
of nations:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">To be called civilised, a nation or State must be free from the following—</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Let me interrupt for a moment to point out that the young author identifies “civilised”
with “just,” and especially that, putting aside prejudice, he describes certain evils
as curable, and regards the healing of <span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span>them as an essential condition of justice. These evils are:—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">1º.</span> The co-existence of poor and rich, and the resultant exploitation.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">2º.</span> Militarism, a means of destruction employed by one nation against another, due to
the bad organisation of society.
</li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">3º.</span> Inequality, which allows some to rule and command, and obliges others to humble themselves
and obey.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>This principle is fundamental and simple, as we should expect to find in an imperfectly
informed mind, and it would not enable one to solve a complete sociological problem;
but it has the advantage of keeping the mind open to fresh knowledge. It is as if
one asked: What does a sick man need to recover health? And the reply is: His suffering
must disappear. This is a naive and natural reply, and would certainly not be given
by a child brought up in the ordinary way; such a child would be taught first to consider
the will of supposed supernatural beings. It is clear that this simple way of putting
the problem of life does not shut out the hope of a reasonable solution; indeed, the
one logically demands the other, as the same child’s essay shows:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">I do not mean that, if there were no rich, or soldiers, or rulers, or wages, people
would abuse their liberty and welfare, but that, with everybody enjoying a high degree
of civilisation, there would be universal cordiality and friendship, and science would
make much greater progress, not being interrupted by wars and political stagnation.</p>
</blockquote><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span></p>
<p>A girl of nine made the following sensible observation, which we leave in her own
incorrect language:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">A criminal is condemned to death; if the murderer deserves this punishment, the man
who condemns him and the man who kills him are also murderers; logically, they ought
to die as well, and so humanity would come to an end. It would be better, instead
of punishing a criminal by committing another crime, to give him good advice, so that
he will not do it again. Besides, if we are all equal, there would be no thieves,
or assassins, or rich people, or poor, but all would be equal and love work and liberty.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The simplicity, clearness, and soundness of this observation need no commentary. One
can understand our astonishment to hear it from the lips of a tender and very pretty
little girl, who looked more like a symbolical representation of truth and justice
than a living reality.
</p>
<p>A boy of twelve deals with sincerity, and says:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The man who is not sincere does not live peacefully; he is always afraid of being
discovered: when one is sincere, if one has done wrong, the sincere declaration relieves
the conscience. If a man begins to tell lies in childhood, he will tell bigger lies
when he grows up, and may do much harm. There are cases in which one need not be sincere.
For instance, if a man comes to our house, flying from the police, and we are asked
afterwards if we have seen him, we must deny it; the contrary would be treachery and
cowardice.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>It is sad that the mind of a child who regards truth as an incomparable good, “without
which it is <span class="pageNum" id="pb91">[<a href="#pb91">91</a>]</span>impossible to live,” is induced by certain grave abuses to consider lying a virtue
in some cases.
</p>
<p>A girl of thirteen writes of fanaticism, and, regarding it as a characteristic of
backward countries, she goes on to seek the cause:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Fanaticism is the outcome of the state of ignorance and backwardness of women; on
that account Catholics do not want to see women educated, as they are the chief support
of their system.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>A profound observation on the causes of fanaticism, and the cause of the causes. Another
girl of thirteen indicates the best remedy of the evil in the following lines:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">The mixed school, for both sexes, is supremely necessary. The boy who studies, works,
and plays in the society of girls learns gradually to respect and help her, and the
girl reciprocally; whereas, if they are educated separately, and the boy is told that
the girl is not a good companion and she is worse than he, the boy will not respect
women when he is a man, and will regard her as a subject or a slave, and that is the
position in which we find women. So we must all work for the foundation of mixed schools,
wherever it is possible, and where it is not possible we must try to remove the difficulties.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>A boy of twelve regards the school as worthy of all respect, because we learn in it
to read, write, and think, and it is the basis of morality and science; he adds:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">If it were not for the school we should live like savages, walk naked, eat herbs and
raw flesh, and dwell in caves and trees; that is to say, we should live a brutal life.
In time, as a result of the school, <span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>everybody will be more intelligent, and there will be no wars or inflamed populations,
and people will look back on war with horror as a work of death and destruction. It
is a great disgrace that there are children who wander in the streets and do not go
to school, and when they become men it is more disgraceful. So let us be grateful
to our teachers for the patience they show in instructing us, and let us regard the
school with respect.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>If that child preserves and develops the faculties it exhibits, it will know how to
harmonise egoism and altruism for its own good and that of society. A girl of eleven
deplores that nations destroy each other in war, and laments the difference of social
classes and that the rich live on the work and privation of the poor. She ends:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Why do not men, instead of killing each other in wars and hating each other for class-differences,
devote themselves cheerfully to work and the discovery of things for the good of mankind?
Men ought to unite to love each other and live fraternally.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1693src" href="#xd31e1693">1</a></p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>A child of ten, in an essay which is so good that I would insert it whole if space
permitted, and if it were not for the identity in sentiment with the previous passages,
says of the school and the pupil:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Reunited under one roof, eager to learn what we <span class="pageNum" id="pb93">[<a href="#pb93">93</a>]</span>do not know, without distinction of classes [there were children of university professors
among them, it will be remembered], we are children of one family guided to the same
end.… The ignorant man is a nullity; little or nothing can be expected of him. He
is a warning to us not to waste time; on the contrary, let us profit by it, and in
due course we will be rewarded. Let us not miss the fruits of a good school, and,
honouring our teachers, our family, and society, we shall live happily.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>A child of ten philosophises on the faults of mankind, which, in her opinion, can
be avoided by instruction and goodwill:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Among the faults of mankind are lying, hypocrisy, and egoism. If men, and especially
women, were better instructed, and women were entirely equal to men, these faults
would disappear. Parents would not send their children to religious schools, which
inculcate false ideas, but to rational schools, where there is no teaching of the
supernatural, which does not exist; nor to make war; but to live in solidarity and
work in common.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>We will close with the following essay, written by a young lady of sixteen, which
is correct enough in form and substance to quote in entirety:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">What inequality there is in the present social order! Some working from morning to
night without more profit than enough to buy their insufficient food; others receiving
the products of the workers in order to enjoy themselves with the superfluous. Why
is this so? Are we not all equal? Undoubtedly we are; but society does not recognise
it, while some are destined to work and suffering, and others to <span class="pageNum" id="pb94">[<a href="#pb94">94</a>]</span>idleness and enjoyment. If a worker shows that he realises the exploitation to which
he is subject, he is blamed and cruelly punished, while others suffer the inequality
with patience. The worker must educate himself; and in order to do this it is necessary
to found free schools, maintained by the wages which the rich give. In this way the
worker will advance more and more, until he is regarded as he deserves, since the
most useful mission of society depends on him.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Whatever be the logical value of these ideas, this collection shows the chief aim
of the Modern School—namely, that the mind of the child, influenced by what it sees
and informed by the positive knowledge it acquires, shall work freely, without prejudice
or submission to any kind of sect, with perfect autonomy and no other guide but reason,
equal in all, and sanctioned by the cogency of evidence, before which the darkness
of sophistry and dogmatic imposition is dispelled.
</p>
<p>In December, 1903, the Congress of Railway Workers, which was then held at Barcelona,
informed us that, as a part of its programme, the delegates would visit the Modern
School. The pupils were delighted, and we invited them to write essays to be read
on the occasion of the visit. The visit was prevented by unforeseen circumstances;
but we published in the <i>Bulletin</i> the children’s essays, which exhaled a delicate perfume of sincerity and unbiassed
judgment, graced by the naive ingenuousness of the writers. No suggestion was made
to them, and they did not compare notes, yet there was a remarkable <span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>agreement in their sentiments. At another time the pupils of the Workers’ School at
Badalona sent a greeting to our pupils, and they again wrote essays, from which we
compiled a return letter of greeting.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1724src" href="#xd31e1724">2</a>

<h2 class="main">THE <i>BULLETIN</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Modern School needed and found its organ in the Press. The political and ordinary
press, which at one time favoured us and at another time denounced us as dangerous,
cannot maintain an impartial attitude. It either gives exaggerated or unmerited praise,
or calumnious censures. The only remedy for this was the sincerity and clearness of
our own indications. To allow these libels to pass without correction would have done
us considerable harm, and the <i>Bulletin</i> enabled us to meet them.
</p>
<p>The directors published in it the programme of the school, interesting notes about
it, statistical details, original pædagogical articles by the teachers, accounts of
the progress of rational education in our own and other countries, translations of
important articles from foreign reviews and periodicals which were in harmony with
the main character of our work, reports of the Sunday lectures, and announcements
of the public competitions for the engagement of teachers and of our library.
</p>
<p>One of the most successful sections of the <i>Bulletin</i> was that devoted to the publication of the ideas of the pupils. Besides showing their
individual ideas it <span class="pageNum" id="pb97">[<a href="#pb97">97</a>]</span>revealed the spontaneous manifestation of common sense. Girls and boys, with no appreciable
difference in intellect according to sex, in contact with the realities of life as
indicated by the teachers, expressed themselves in simple essays which, though sometimes
immature in judgment, more often showed the clear logic with which they conceived
philosophical, political, or social questions of some importance. The journal was
at first distributed without charge among the pupils, and was exchanged with other
periodicals; but there was soon a demand for it, and a public subscription had to
be opened. When this was done, the <i>Bulletin</i> became a philosophical review, as well as organ of the Modern School; and it retained
this character until the persecution began and the school was closed. An instance
of the important mission of the <i>Bulletin</i> will be found in the following article, which I wrote in No. 5 of the fourth year,
in order to correct certain secular teachers who had gone astray:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">A certain Workers’ School has introduced the novelty of establishing a savings-bank,
administered by the pupils. This piece of information, reproduced in terms of great
praise by the press as a thing to be imitated, induces us to express our opinion on
the subject. While others have their own right to decide and act, we have the same
right to criticise, and thus to create a rational public opinion.
</p>
<p>In the first place we would observe that the word <i>economy</i> is very different from, if not the opposite of, the idea of <i>saving</i>. One may teach children the knowledge and practice of economy without necessarily
<span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>teaching them to save. <i>Economy</i> means a prudent and methodical use of one’s goods: <i>saving</i> means a restriction of one’s use of one’s goods. By economising, we avoid waste;
by saving, the man who has nothing superfluous deprives himself of what is necessary.
</p>
<p>Have the children who are taught to save any superfluous property? The very name of
the society in question assures us that they have not. The workers who send their
children to this school live on their wages, the minimum sum, determined by the laws
of supply and demand, which is paid for their work by the employers; and as this wage
gives them nothing superfluous, and the social wealth is monopolised by the privileged
classes, the workers are far from obtaining enough to live a life in harmony with
the progress of civilisation. Hence, when these children of workers, and future workers
themselves, are taught to save—which is a voluntary privation under the appearance
of interest—they are taught to prepare themselves to submit to privilege. While the
intention is to initiate them to the practice of economy, what is really done is to
convert them into victims and accomplices of the present unjust order.
</p>
<p>The working-class child is a human child, and, as such, it has a right to the development
of all its faculties, the satisfaction of all its needs, moral and physical. For that
purpose society was instituted. It is not its function to repress or subject the individual,
as is selfishly pretended by the privileged and reactionary class, and all who enjoy
what others produce; it has to hold the balance justly between the rights and duties
of all members of the commonwealth.
</p>
<p>As it is, the individual is asked to sacrifice his <span class="pageNum" id="pb99">[<a href="#pb99">99</a>]</span>rights, needs, and pleasures to society; and, as this disorder demands patience, suffering,
and sophistical reasoning, let us commend economy and blame saving. We do not think
it right to teach children to look forward to being workers in a social order in which
the average mortality of the poor, who live without freedom, instruction, or joy,
reaches an appalling figure in comparison with that of the class which lives in triumph
on their labour. Those who, from sociolatry, would derogate in the least from the
rights of man, should read the fine and vigorous words of Pi y Margall: “Who art thou
to prevent my use of my human rights? Perfidious and tyrannical society, thou wert
created to defend, not to coerce us. Go back to the abyss whence thou came.”
</p>
<p>Starting from these principles, and applying them to pædagogy, we think it necessary
to teach children that to waste any class of objects is contrary to the general welfare;
that if a child spoils paper, loses pens, or destroys books, it does an injustice
to its parents and the school. Assuredly one may impress on the child the need of
prudence in order to avoid getting imperfect things, and remind it of lack of employment,
illness, or age; but it is not right to insist that a provision be made out of a salary
which does not suffice to meet the needs of life. That is bad arithmetic.
</p>
<p>The workers have no university training; they do not go to the theatre or to concerts;
they never go into ecstasies before the marvels of art, industry, or nature; they
have no holiday in which to fill their lungs with life-giving oxygen; they are never
uplifted by reading books or reviews. On the contrary, they suffer all kinds of privations,
and may have to endure <span class="pageNum" id="pb100">[<a href="#pb100">100</a>]</span>crises due to excessive production. It is not the place of teachers to hide these
sad truths from the children, and to tell them that a smaller quantity is equal to,
if not better than, a larger. In order that the power of science and industry be shared
by all, and all be invited to partake of the banquet of life, we must not teach in
the school, in the interest of privilege, that the poor should organise the advantages
of crumbs and leavings. We must not prostitute education.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>On another occasion I had to censure a different departure from our principles:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">We were distressed and indignant on reading the list of contributions voted by the
Council of Barcelona for certain popular societies which are interested in education.
We read of sums offered to Republican Fraternities and similar societies; and we find
that, instead of rejecting them, they forwarded votes of thanks to the Council.
</p>
<p>The meaning of these things in a Catholic and ultra-conservative nation is clear.
The Church and the capitalist system only maintain their ascendency by a judicious
system of charity and protection. With this they gratify the disinherited class, and
continue to enjoy its respect. But we cannot see republicans acting as if they were
humble Christians without raising a cry of alarm.
</p>
<p>Beware, we repeat, beware! You are educating your children badly, and taking the wrong
path towards reform, in accepting alms. You will neither emancipate yourselves nor
your children if you trust in the strength of others, and rely on official or private
support. Let the Catholics, ignorant of the realities of life, expect everything of
God, or St. Joseph, or <span class="pageNum" id="pb101">[<a href="#pb101">101</a>]</span>some similar being, and, as they have no security that their prayers will be heard
in this life, trust to receive a reward after death. Let gamblers in the lottery fail
to see that they are morally and materially victimised by their rulers, and trust
to receive by chance what they do not earn by energy. But it is sad to see men hold
out the hand of a beggar who are united in a revolutionary protest against the present
system; to see them admitting and giving thanks for humiliating gifts, instead of
trusting their own energy, intellect, and ability.
</p>
<p>Beware, then, all men of good faith! That is not the way to set up a true education
of children, but the way to enslave them.</p>

<h2 class="label"><span class="sc">Chapter XVII.</span></h2>
<h2 class="main">THE CLOSING OF THE MODERN SCHOOL</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I have reached the culmination of my life and my work. My enemies, who are all the
reactionaries in the world, represented by the reactionaries of Barcelona and of Spain,
believed that they had triumphed by involving me in a charge of attempted assassination.
But their triumph proved to be only an episode in the struggle of practical Rationalism
against reaction. The shameful audacity with which they claimed sentence of death
against me (a claim that was refused on account of my transparent innocence rather
than on account of the justice of the court) drew on me the sympathy of all liberal
men—all true progressives—in all parts of the world, and fixed attention on the meaning
and ideal of the Rational School. There was a universal and uninterrupted movement
of protest and admiration for a whole year—from May, 1906, to May and June, 1907—echoed
in the Press of every civilised country, and in meetings and other popular manifestations.
</p>
<p>It proved in the end that the mortal enemies of our work were its most effective supporters,
as they led to the establishment of international Rationalism.
</p>
<p>I felt my own littleness in face of this mighty <span class="pageNum" id="pb103">[<a href="#pb103">103</a>]</span>manifestation. Led always by the light of the ideal, I conceived and carried out the
International League for the Rational Education of Children, in the various branches
of which, scattered over the world, are found men in the front ranks of culture [Anatole
France, Ernst Haeckel, etc.]. It has three organs, <i lang="fr">L’École Renovée</i> in France, the <i>Bulletin</i> in Barcelona, and <i lang="it">La Scuola Laica</i> at Rome, which expound, discuss, and spread all the latest efforts of pædagogy to
purify science from all defilement of error, to dispel all credulity, to bring about
a perfect harmony between belief and knowledge, and to destroy that privileged esoteric
system which has always left an exoteric doctrine to the masses.
</p>
<p>This great concentration of knowledge and research must lead to a vigorous action
which will give to the future revolution the character of practical manifestation
of applied sociology, without passion or demand of revenge, with no terrible tragedies
or heroic sacrifices, no sterile movements, no disillusion of zealots, no treacherous
returns to reaction. For scientific and rational education will have pervaded the
masses, making each man and woman a self-conscious, active, and responsible being,
guiding his will according to his judgment, free for ever from the passions inspired
by those who exploit respect for tradition and for the charlatanry of the modern framers
of political programmes.
</p>
<p>If progress thus loses this dramatic character of revolution, it will gain in firmness,
stability, and continuity, as evolution. The vision of a rational <span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span>society, which revolutionaries foresaw in all ages, and which sociologists confidently
promise, will rise before the eyes of our successors, not as the mirage of dreamy
utopians, but as the positive and merited triumph won by the revolutionary power of
reason and science.
</p>
<p>The new repute of the educational work of the Modern School attracted the attention
of all who appreciated the value of sound instruction. There was a general demand
for knowledge of the system. There were numbers of private secular schools, or similar
institutions supported by societies, and their directors made inquiry concerning the
difference of our methods from theirs. There were constant requests to visit the school
and consult me. I gladly satisfied them, removed their doubts, and pressed them to
enter on the new way; and at once efforts were made to reform the existing schools,
and to create others on the model of the Modern School.
</p>
<p>There was great enthusiasm and the promise of mighty things; but one serious difficulty
stood in the way: we were short of teachers, and had no means of creating them. Professional
teachers had two disadvantages—traditional habits and dread of the contingencies of
the future. There were very few who, in an unselfish love of the ideal, would devote
themselves to the progressive cause. Instructed young men and women might be found
to fill the gap; but how were we to train them ? Where could they pass their apprenticeship?
Now and again I heard from <span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>workers’ or political societies that they had decided to open a school; they would
find rooms and appliances, and we could count upon their using our school manuals.
But whenever I asked if they had teachers, they replied in the negative, and thought
it would be easy to supply the want. I had to give in.
</p>
<p>Circumstances had made me the director of rationalist education, and I had constant
consultations and demands on the part of aspirants for the position of teacher. This
made me realise the defect, and I endeavoured to meet it by private advice and by
admitting young assistants in the Modern School. The result was naturally mixed. There
are now worthy teachers who will carry on the work of rational education elsewhere;
others failed from moral or intellectual incapacity.
</p>
<p>Not feeling that the pupils of the Modern School who devoted themselves to teaching
would find time for their work, I established a Normal School, of which I have already
spoken. I was convinced that, if the key of the social problem is in the scientific
and rational school, it is essential, to make a proper use of the key, that fitting
teachers be trained for so great a destiny.
</p>
<p>As the practical and positive result of my work, I may say that the Modern School
of Barcelona was a most successful experiment, and that it was distinguished for two
characters:—
</p>
<ul>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">1º.</span> While open to successive improvements, it set up a standard of what education should
be in a reformed state of society.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span></li>
<li class="numberedItem"><span class="itemNumber">2º.</span> It gave an impulse to the spread of this kind of education.</li>
</ul><p>
</p>
<p>There was up to that time no education in the true sense of the word. There were,
for the privileged few in the universities, traditional errors and prejudices, authoritarian
dogmas, mixed up with the truths which modern research has brought to light. For the
people there was primary instruction, which was, and is, a method of taming children.
The school was a sort of riding-school, where natural energies were subdued in order
that the poor might suffer their hard lot in silence. Real education, separated from
faith—education that illumines the mind with the light of evidence—is the creation
of the Modern School.
</p>
<p>During its ephemeral existence<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1836src" href="#xd31e1836">1</a> it did a marvellous amount of good. The child admitted to the school and kept in
contact with its companions rapidly changed its habits, as I have observed. It cultivated
cleanliness, avoided quarrels, ceased to be cruel to animals, took no notice in its
games of the barbarous spectacle which we call the national entertainment [bull-fight],
and, as its mind was uplifted and its sentiments purified, it deplored the social
injustices which abound on the very face of life. It detested war, and would not admit
that national glory, instead of consisting in the highest possible moral development
and happiness of a people, should be placed in conquest and violence.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb107">[<a href="#pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p>The influence of the Modern School, extended to other schools which had been founded
on its model and were maintained by various working-men societies, penetrated the
families by means of the children. Once they were touched by the influence of reason
and science they were unconsciously converted into teachers of their own parents,
and these in turn diffused the better standards among their friends and relatives.
</p>
<p>This spread of our influence drew on us the hatred of Jesuitism of all kinds and in
all places, and this hatred inspired the design which ended in the closing of the
Modern School. It is closed; but in reality it is concentrating its forces, defining
and improving its plan, and gathering the strength for a fresh attempt to promote
the true cause of progress.
</p>
<p>That is the story of what the Modern School was, is, and ought to be.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first xd31e1848"><span class="sc">By J. M.</span>
</p>
<p>“That is the story of what the Modern School was, is, and ought to be.” When Ferrer
wrote this, in the summer of 1908, he was full of plans for the continuation of his
work in various ways. He was fostering such free schools as the Government still permitted.
He was promoting his “popular university,” and multiplying works of science and sociology
for the million. His influence was growing, and he saw with glad eyes the light breaking
on the ignorant masses of his fellows. In the summer of 1909 he came to England to
study the system of moral instruction which, under the inspiration of the Moral Instruction
League, is used in thousands of English schools. A friend in London begged him never
to return to Spain, as his life was sought. He knew it, but nothing would divert him
from his ideal. And three months later he was shot, among the graves of criminals,
in the trenches of Montjuich.
</p>
<p>Form your own opinion of him from his words. He conceals nothing. He was a rebel against
religious traditions and social inequalities; he wished children to become as resentful
of poverty and superstition as he. There is no law of Spain, or of any <span class="pageNum" id="pb110">[<a href="#pb110">110</a>]</span>other country, that forbids such enterprise as his. He might be shot in Russia, of
course; for the law has been suspended there for more than a decade. In Spain men
had to lie in order to take his life.
</p>
<p>With the particular value of his scheme of education I am not concerned. He was well
acquainted with pædagogical literature, and there were few elementary schools in Spain
to equal his. Writers who have spoken slightingly of his school, apart from its social
dogmas, know little or nothing about it. Ferrer was in close and constant association
with two of the ablest professors in the university of Barcelona, one of whom sent
his children to the school, and with distinguished scholars in other lands. There
was more stimulating work done in the Modern School than, probably, in any other elementary
school in Spain, if not elsewhere. All that can be questioned is the teaching of an
explicit social creed to the children. Ferrer would have rejoined that there was not
a school in Europe that does not teach an explicit social creed. But, however we may
differ from his creed, we cannot fail to recognise the elevated and unselfish idealism
of the man, and deplore the brutality and illegality with which his genial life was
prematurely brought to a close.

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
